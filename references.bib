               by allowing the interrogation of causal control among brain

  abstract = "The standard rodent model of itch uses scratching with the hind
              limb as a behavioral response to pruritic stimuli applied to the
              nape of the neck. The assumption is that scratching is an
              indicator of the sensation of itch. But because only one type of
              site-directed behavior is available, one cannot be certain that
              scratching is not a response to nociceptive or other qualities of
              sensations in addition to, or instead of, itch. To extend the
              model, we administered chemical stimuli to the cheek of the mouse
              and counted scratching with the hind limb as an indicator of itch
              and wiping with the forelimb as an indicator of pain. An
              intradermal injection of histamine and capsaicin, known to evoke
              predominantly itch and pain, respectively, in humans, each
              elicited hind limb scratching behavior when injected into the
              nape of the neck of the mouse. In contrast, when the same
              chemicals were injected into the cheek of the mouse, there were
              two site-directed behaviors: histamine again elicited scratching
              with the hind limb, but capsaicin evoked wiping with the
              forelimb. We conclude that the ``cheek model of itch'' in the
              mouse provides a behavioral differentiation of chemicals that
              elicit predominantly itch in humans from those that evoke
              nociceptive sensations. That is, the model provides a behavioral
              differentiation between itch and pain in the mouse.",

              Unfortunately, currently available itch medications are

              their relative power for detecting context-modulated FC is

              simulations to compare power for detecting context-modulated FC

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Statistical methods that simultaneously model temporal
              and spatial variations of fMRI data are promising tools for
              dynamic functional connectivity (FC) estimation. Although
              different approaches are available, they need to manually set the
              parameters, or may disregard some important fMRI features such as
              the autocorrelation. In addition, no reliable method exists for
              the validation of dynamic FC analysis models. APPROACH: In the
              present study, we have proposed an autoregressive dynamic
              conditional correlation model to deal with the temporal
              autocorrelation and non-stationarity in fMRI time-series. This
              model assumes that the brain time courses follow a multivariate
              Gaussian distribution, and that the conditional mean, variance
              and covariances change in an autoregressive form. Also, we
              proposed a new measurement index for the evaluation of the
              statistical consistency between the inferred dynamic functional
              connectivity and the real fMRI data. The performance of our model
              was tested in both simulated and real fMRI data. MAIN RESULTS:
              The model was associated with independent Gaussian residuals, and
              identified the dynamic connectivity patterns with high precision.
              Applying the model to the fMRI data from typically developing and
              attention deficit hyperactivity disorder subjects, brain
              connectivities were significantly different between the two
              groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Prominent features of our model were the
              consideration of the fMRI autocorrelation, no need to adjust the
              window length, and also elimination of the variance changes in
              each brain time-course from its connectivity changes.",

              subjects could increase their own NAcc activity, and that display

              Subjects were not as capable of decreasing their NAcc activity,

              removal of neurofeedback. Further analyses suggested that

               in which they were asked to decrease activity in the sACC
               without neurofeedback; (2) two training scans in which sACC
               neurofeedback was presented along with instructions to decrease

               An additional nine women in a yoked feedback control group saw
               sACC activity from the participants in the experimental group.
               Activity in the sACC was significantly reduced during

              chronic pain with analgesics is around 30\%. Both treatment and
              research into chronic pain are greatly compromised by the fact
              that there is no objective diagnostic test that can complement
              the subjective assessment of chronic pain conditions. Chronic
              pain is now considered to be a disease of the central nervous
              system. Since behavior (including pain or analgesia) results from
              activity in brain circuits through the participation of many

              significantly contributed to post-stimulus ratings, while
              temporal components such as perceived duration of pain
              contributed minimally. Additional regression analyses revealed
              that mean and peak responses of real-time intensity ratings
              accounted for much of the variability of post-stimulus
              unpleasantness ratings whereas real-time unpleasantness ratings
              accounted for somewhat less of the variability of post-stimulus
              intensity ratings. Taken together, the close relationship between
              real-time and post-stimulus ratings of pain across stimulus
              conditions evoking both adaptation and temporal summation further
              confirms that post-stimulus, retrospective ratings of pain are
              valid measures of the real-time experience of pain.",

  abstract = "Background: Despite the continuing epidemic of opioid misuse,
              data on the prevalence of prescription opioid use, misuse, and
              use disorders are limited. Objective: To estimate the prevalence
              of prescription opioid use, misuse, and use disorders and
              motivations for misuse among U.S. adults. Design: Survey.
              Setting: The 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).
              Participants: 72 600 eligible civilian, noninstitutionalized
              adults were selected for NSDUH, and 51 200 completed the survey
              interview. Measurements: Prescription opioid use, misuse, and use
              disorders. Results: Weighted NSDUH estimates suggested that, in
              2015, 91.8 million (37.8\%) U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized
              adults used prescription opioids; 11.5 million (4.7\%) misused
              them; and 1.9 million (0.8\%) had a use disorder. Among adults
              with prescription opioid use, 12.5\% reported misuse; of these,
              16.7\% reported a prescription opioid use disorder. The most
              commonly reported motivation for misuse was to relieve physical
              pain (63.4\%). Misuse and use disorders were most commonly
              reported in adults who were uninsured, were unemployed, had low
              income, or had behavioral health problems. Among adults with
              misuse, 59.9\% reported using opioids without a prescription, and
              40.8\% obtained prescription opioids for free from friends or
              relatives for their most recent episode of misuse. Limitation:
              Cross-sectional, self-reported data. Conclusion: More than one
              third of U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized adults reported
              prescription opioid use in 2015, with substantial numbers
              reporting misuse and use disorders. Relief from physical pain was
              the most commonly reported motivation for misuse. Economic
              disadvantage and behavioral health problems may be associated
              with prescription opioid misuse. The results suggest a need to
              improve access to evidence-based pain management and to decrease
              excessive prescribing that may leave unused opioids available for
              potential misuse. Primary Funding Source: U.S. Department of

              structure) from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medications
              for knee osteoarthritis. Data Sources and Study Selection: The
              databases of MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the
              Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched
              until June 30, 2018 (MEDLINE alerts through August 31, 2018) for
              RCTs of patients with knee osteoarthritis that had treatment and
              follow-up lasting 1 year or longer. Data Extraction and
              Synthesis: Data at baseline and at the longest available
              treatment and follow-up of 12 months' duration or longer (or the
              change from baseline) were extracted. A Bayesian random-effects
              network meta-analysis was performed. Main Outcomes and Measures:
              The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in knee
              pain. Secondary outcomes were physical function and joint
              structure (the latter was measured radiologically as joint space
              narrowing). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and mean
              differences with 95\% credibility intervals (95\% CrIs) were
              calculated. Findings were interpreted as associations when the
              95\% CrIs excluded the null value. Results: Forty-seven RCTs (22
              037 patients; mean age range, mostly 55-70 years; and a higher
              mean proportion of women than men, around 70\%) included the
              following medication categories: analgesics; antioxidants;
              bone-acting agents such as bisphosphonates and strontium
              ranelate; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; intra-articular
              injection medications such as hyaluronic acid and
              corticosteroids; symptomatic slow-acting drugs in osteoarthritis
              such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate; and putative
              disease-modifying agents such as cindunistat and sprifermin.
              Thirty-one interventions were studied for pain, 13 for physical
              function, and 16 for joint structure. Trial duration ranged from
              1 to 4 years. Associations with decreases in pain were found for
              the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (SMD, -0.18
              [95\% CrI, -0.35 to -0.01]) and the symptomatic slow-acting drug
              in osteoarthritis glucosamine sulfate (SMD, -0.29 [95\% CrI,
              -0.49 to -0.09]), but there was large uncertainty for all
              estimates vs placebo. The association with pain improvement
              remained significant only for glucosamine sulfate when data were
              analyzed using the mean difference on a scale from 0 to 100 and
              when trials at high risk of bias were excluded. Associations with
              improvement in joint space narrowing were found for glucosamine
              sulfate (SMD, -0.42 [95\% CrI, -0.65 to -0.19]), chondroitin
              sulfate (SMD, -0.20 [95\% CrI, -0.31 to -0.07]), and strontium
              ranelate (SMD, -0.20 [95\% CrI, -0.36 to -0.05]). Conclusions and
              Relevance: In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of
              studies of patients with knee osteoarthritis and at least 12
              months of follow-up, there was uncertainty around the estimates
              of effect size for change in pain for all comparisons with
              placebo. Larger RCTs are needed to resolve the uncertainty around

              pain remain unclear. Objective: To systematically review
              randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of opioids for chronic
              noncancer pain. Data Sources and Study Selection: The databases
              of CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, AMED, and PsycINFO were
              searched from inception to April 2018 for RCTs of opioids for
              chronic noncancer pain vs any nonopioid control. Data Extraction
              and Synthesis: Paired reviewers independently extracted data. The

              Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to rate
              the quality of the evidence. Main Outcomes and Measures: The
              primary outcomes were pain intensity (score range, 0-10 cm on a
              visual analog scale for pain; lower is better and the minimally
              important difference [MID] is 1 cm), physical functioning (score
              range, 0-100 points on the 36-item Short Form physical component
              score [SF-36 PCS]; higher is better and the MID is 5 points), and
              incidence of vomiting. Results: Ninety-six RCTs including 26 169
              participants (61\% female; median age, 58 years [interquartile
              range, 51-61 years]) were included. Of the included studies,
              there were 25 trials of neuropathic pain, 32 trials of
              nociceptive pain, 33 trials of central sensitization (pain
              present in the absence of tissue damage), and 6 trials of mixed
              types of pain. Compared with placebo, opioid use was associated
              with reduced pain (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.69 cm [95\%
              CI, -0.82 to -0.56 cm] on a 10-cm visual analog scale for pain;
              modeled risk difference for achieving the MID, 11.9\% [95\% CI,
              9.7\% to 14.1\%]), improved physical functioning (WMD, 2.04
              points [95\% CI, 1.41 to 2.68 points] on the 100-point SF-36 PCS;
              modeled risk difference for achieving the MID, 8.5\% [95\% CI,
              5.9\% to 11.2\%]), and increased vomiting (5.9\% with opioids vs
              2.3\% with placebo for trials that excluded patients with adverse
              events during a run-in period). Low- to moderate-quality evidence
              suggested similar associations of opioids with improvements in
              pain and physical functioning compared with nonsteroidal
              anti-inflammatory drugs (pain: WMD, -0.60 cm [95\% CI, -1.54 to
              0.34 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, -0.90 points [95\% CI, -2.69
              to 0.89 points]), tricyclic antidepressants (pain: WMD, -0.13 cm
              [95\% CI, -0.99 to 0.74 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, -5.31
              points [95\% CI, -13.77 to 3.14 points]), and anticonvulsants
              (pain: WMD, -0.90 cm [95\% CI, -1.65 to -0.14 cm]; physical
              functioning: WMD, 0.45 points [95\% CI, -5.77 to 6.66 points]).
              Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-analysis of RCTs of
              patients with chronic noncancer pain, evidence from high-quality
              studies showed that opioid use was associated with statistically
              significant but small improvements in pain and physical
              functioning, and increased risk of vomiting compared with
              placebo. Comparisons of opioids with nonopioid alternatives
              suggested that the benefit for pain and functioning may be
              similar, although the evidence was from studies of only low to
              moderate quality.",

              patients longitudinally for 3 years as they either recovered from
              or transitioned to chronic pain. Whole-brain comparisons
              indicated corticolimbic, but not pain-related circuitry, white
              matter connections predisposed patients to chronic pain.
              Intra-corticolimbic white matter connectivity analysis identified

  abstract = "Distal limb pain in diabetes mellitus is frequently attributed to
              hyperexcitability of primary afferents associated with peripheral
              neuropathy. However, prior studies have demonstrated that, after
              traumatic nerve injury, hyperexcitability develops not only
              within primary afferents but also within pain-signalling neurons
              of the spinal cord dorsal horn and thalamic ventral
              posterolateral (VPL) nucleus, establishing a basis for tiered
              central pain generators or amplifiers. In this study we asked
              whether hyperexcitability develops within thalamic neurons in
              experimental painful diabetes. Diabetes was induced in adult male
              Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin (STZ). Behavioral testing
              for tactile allodynia, performed one week prior to STZ injection
              and weekly thereafter, indicated that, by six weeks after STZ
              injection, mechanical allodynia had developed (mechanical
              withdrawal threshold <4 g, STZ; 21.75 g, control). Thalamic unit
              recordings were obtained from the VPL nucleus at seven weeks
              after STZ injection, in rats that met a criterion withdrawal
              threshold of <4 g, at a time when mean glucose level for control
              rats was 104.8+/-2.9, and for diabetic rats was 420.1+/-42.0. Our
              analysis shows that, in this model of diabetic neuropathic pain,
              thalamic VPL neurons develop hyperexcitability, with increased
              responses to phasic brush, press, and pinch stimuli applied to
              identified peripheral receptive fields. VPL neurons from diabetic
              rats also display enhanced spontaneous activity, independent of
              ascending afferent barrage, and enlarged receptive fields. These
              results suggest that aberrant levels of spontaneous activity and
              hyper-responsiveness of VPL thalamic neurons may contribute to
              diabetic neuropathic pain.",

              overlapping conditions, eg, irritable bowel syndrome, headaches,
              and chronic fatigue syndrome, within the concept of central
              sensitivity syndromes (CSS). METHODS: A critical overview of the
              literature and incorporation of the author's own views. RESULTS:
              The concept of CSS seems viable. It is based on mutual
              associations among the CSS conditions as well as the evidence for
              central sensitization (CS) among several CSS members. However,
              such evidence is weak or not available in other members at this
              time, requiring further studies. The biology of CSS is based on
              neuroendocrine aberrations, including CS, that interact with
              psychosocial factors to cause a number of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
              CSS is an important new concept that embraces the biopsychosocial
              model of disease. Further critical studies are warranted to fully
              test this concept. However, it seems to have important
              significance for new directions for research and patient care
              involving physician and patient education. Each patient,
              irrespective of diagnosis, should be treated as an individual

              in the excitability and synaptic efficacy of neurons in central

              Central sensitization manifests as pain hypersensitivity,
              particularly dynamic tactile allodynia, secondary punctate or
              pressure hyperalgesia, aftersensations, and enhanced temporal
              summation. It can be readily and rapidly elicited in human
              volunteers by diverse experimental noxious conditioning stimuli
              to skin, muscles or viscera, and in addition to producing pain
              hypersensitivity, results in secondary changes in brain activity
              that can be detected by electrophysiological or imaging
              techniques. Studies in clinical cohorts reveal changes in pain
              sensitivity that have been interpreted as revealing an important
              contribution of central sensitization to the pain phenotype in
              patients with fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal
              disorders with generalized pain hypersensitivity, headache,
              temporomandibular joint disorders, dental pain, neuropathic pain,
              visceral pain hypersensitivity disorders and post-surgical pain.
              The comorbidity of those pain hypersensitivity syndromes that
              present in the absence of inflammation or a neural lesion, their
              similar pattern of clinical presentation and response to
              centrally acting analgesics, may reflect a commonality of central
              sensitization to their pathophysiology. An important question
              that still needs to be determined is whether there are
              individuals with a higher inherited propensity for developing
              central sensitization than others, and if so, whether this
              conveys an increased risk in both developing conditions with pain
              hypersensitivity, and their chronification. Diagnostic criteria
              to establish the presence of central sensitization in patients
              will greatly assist the phenotyping of patients for choosing
              treatments that produce analgesia by normalizing hyperexcitable
              central neural activity. We have certainly come a long way since
              the first discovery of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in
              the spinal cord and the revelation that it occurs and produces
              pain hypersensitivity in patients. Nevertheless, discovering the
              genetic and environmental contributors to and objective
              biomarkers of central sensitization will be highly beneficial, as

              recent discoveries on the active role of the cortex in chronic

              brain structure and function. Moreover, some studies indicate
              that brain activity related to the subjective perception of
              chronic pain may be distinct from activity for acute pain.
              However, the latter are based on observations from
              cross-sectional studies. How brain activity reorganizes with
              transition from acute to chronic pain has remained unexplored.
              Here we study this transition by examining brain activity for
              rating fluctuations of back pain magnitude. First we compared
              back pain-related brain activity between subjects who have had
              the condition for ∼2 months with no prior history of back pain
              for 1 year (early, acute/subacute back pain group, n = 94), to
              subjects who have lived with back pain for >10 years (chronic
              back pain group, n = 59). In a subset of subacute back pain
              patients, we followed brain activity for back pain longitudinally
              over a 1-year period, and compared brain activity between those
              who recover (recovered acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 19)
              and those in which the back pain persists (persistent
              acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 20; based on a 20\% decrease
              in intensity of back pain in 1 year). We report results in
              relation to meta-analytic probabilistic maps related to the terms
              pain, emotion, and reward (each map is based on >200 brain
              imaging studies, derived from neurosynth.org). We observed that
              brain activity for back pain in the early, acute/subacute back
              pain group is limited to regions involved in acute pain, whereas
              in the chronic back pain group, activity is confined to
              emotion-related circuitry. Reward circuitry was equally
              represented in both groups. In the recovered acute/subacute back
              pain group, brain activity diminished in time, whereas in the
              persistent acute/subacute back pain group, activity diminished in
              acute pain regions, increased in emotion-related circuitry, and
              remained unchanged in reward circuitry. The results demonstrate
              that brain representation for a constant percept, back pain, can
              undergo large-scale shifts in brain activity with the transition
              to chronic pain. These observations challenge long-standing

              However, it is unclear whether self-regulation primarily
              influences primary nociceptive and affective processes or
              evaluative ones. In this study, participants engaged in
              self-regulation to increase or decrease pain while experiencing
              multiple levels of painful heat during functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging. Both heat intensity and
              self-regulation strongly influenced reported pain, but they did
              so via two distinct brain pathways. The effects of stimulus
              intensity were mediated by the neurologic pain signature (NPS),
              an a priori distributed brain network shown to predict physical
              pain with over 90\% sensitivity and specificity across four
              studies. Self-regulation did not influence NPS responses;
              instead, its effects were mediated through functional connections
              between the nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
              This pathway was unresponsive to noxious input, and has been
              broadly implicated in valuation, emotional appraisal, and
              functional outcomes in pain and other types of affective
              processes. These findings provide evidence that pain reports are
              associated with two dissociable functional systems:

              Responses to Social Threat",

  abstract = "Psychosocial stressors induce autonomic nervous system (ANS)
              responses in multiple body systems that are linked to health
              risks. Much work has focused on the common effects of stress, but
              ANS responses in different body systems are dissociable and may
              result from distinct patterns of cortical-subcortical
              interactions. Here, we used machine learning to develop
              multivariate patterns of fMRI activity predictive of heart rate
              (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL) responses during social
              threat in humans (N = 18). Overall, brain patterns predicted both
              HR and SCL in cross-validated analyses successfully (rHR = 0.54,
              rSCL = 0.58, both p < 0.0001). These patterns partly reflected
              central stress mechanisms common to both responses because each
              pattern predicted the other signal to some degree
              (rHR$\rightarrow$SCL = 0.21 and rSCL$\rightarrow$HR = 0.22, both
              p < 0.01), but they were largely physiological response specific.
              Both patterns included positive predictive weights in dorsal
              anterior cingulate and cerebellum and negative weights in
              ventromedial PFC and local pattern similarity analyses within
              these regions suggested that they encode common central stress
              mechanisms. However, the predictive maps and searchlight analysis
              suggested that the patterns predictive of HR and SCL were
              substantially different across most of the brain, including
              significant differences in ventromedial PFC, insula, lateral PFC,
              pre-SMA, and dmPFC. Overall, the results indicate that specific
              patterns of cerebral activity track threat-induced autonomic
              responses in specific body systems. Physiological measures of
              threat are not interchangeable, but rather reflect specific
              interactions among brain systems. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We show
              that threat-induced increases in heart rate and skin conductance
              share some common representations in the brain, located mainly in
              the vmPFC, temporal and parahippocampal cortices, thalamus, and
              brainstem. However, despite these similarities, the brain
              patterns that predict these two autonomic responses are largely
              distinct. This evidence for largely output-measure-specific
              regulation of autonomic responses argues against a common system
              hypothesis and provides evidence that different autonomic
              measures reflect distinct, measurable patterns of

              analgesia (N = 47), using patterns of fMRI activity during the
              anticipation and experience of pain to predict new subjects'
              scores on placebo analgesia and placebo-induced changes in pain
              processing. We used a cross-validated regression procedure,
              LASSO-PCR, which provided both unbiased estimates of predictive
              accuracy and interpretable maps of which regions are most
              important for prediction. Increased anticipatory activity in a
              frontoparietal network and decreases in a posterior
              insular/temporal network predicted placebo analgesia. Patterns of
              anticipatory activity across the cortex predicted a moderate
              amount of variance in the placebo response (∼12\% overall, ∼40\%

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Persistent pain is measured by means of self-report,
              the sole reliance on which hampers diagnosis and treatment.
              Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for
              identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that
              are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been
              identified. METHODS: In four studies involving a total of 114
              participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts
              pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1,
              we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI
              activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was
              associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the
              thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary
              somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the
              periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we
              tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain
              versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed
              specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the
              same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the
              responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent
              remifentanil. RESULTS: In study 1, the neurologic signature
              showed sensitivity and specificity of 94\% or more (95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful
              heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall.
              In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and
              nonpainful warmth with 93\% sensitivity and specificity (95\% CI,
              84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain
              and social pain with 85\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 76 to 94) and
              73\% specificity (95\% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95\% sensitivity
              and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two
              conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the
              signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil
              was administered. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use fMRI to

              human brain activity patterns from 148 studies of emotion
              categories (2159 total participants) using a novel hierarchical
              Bayesian model. The model allowed us to classify which of five
              categories--fear, anger, disgust, sadness, or happiness--is
              engaged by a study with 66\% accuracy (43-86\% across
              categories). Analyses of the activity patterns encoded in the
              model revealed that each emotion category is associated with
              unique, prototypical patterns of activity across multiple brain
              systems including the cortex, thalamus, amygdala, and other
              structures. The results indicate that emotion categories are not
              contained within any one region or system, but are represented as
              configurations across multiple brain networks. The model provides
              a precise summary of the prototypical patterns for each emotion
              category, and demonstrates that a sufficient characterization of
              emotion categories relies on (a) differential patterns of
              involvement in neocortical systems that differ between humans and
              other species, and (b) distinctive patterns of
              cortical-subcortical interactions. Thus, these findings are
              incompatible with several contemporary theories of emotion,
              including those that emphasize emotion-dedicated brain systems

              mechanical detection thresholds to von Frey filaments and a 64 Hz
              tuning fork, mechanical pain thresholds to pinprick stimuli and

  abstract = "Studies in rats and non-human primates suggest that medial
              temporal lobe (MTL) structures play a role in perceptual
              processing, with the hippocampus necessary for spatial
              discrimination, and the perirhinal cortex for object
              discrimination. Until recently, there was little convergent
              evidence for analogous functional specialisation in humans, or
              for a role of the MTL in processes beyond long-term memory. A
              recent series of novel human neuropsychological studies, however,
              in which paradigms from the animal literature were adapted and
              extended, have revealed findings remarkably similar to those seen
              in rats and monkeys. These experiments have demonstrated
              differential effects of distinct stimulus categories on
              performance in tasks for which there was no explicit requirement
              to remember information across trials. There is also accruing
              complementary evidence from functional neuroimaging that MTL
              structures show differential patterns of activation for scenes
              and objects, even on simple visual discrimination tasks. This
              article reviews some of these key studies and discusses the
              implications of these new findings for existing accounts of
              memory. A non-modular view of memory is proposed in which memory
              and perception depend upon the same anatomically distributed
              representations (emergent memory account). The limitations and
              criticisms of this theory are discussed and a number of
              outstanding questions proposed, including key predictions that
              can be tested by future studies.",

               pain as different sensations. Several researchers have
               investigated neural mechanisms underlying their perceptual
               differences, and found that some C fibers and spinothalamic
               tract neurons had different sensitivity between itching and
               pain. These findings suggest that such differences in ascending
               pathways are partly associated with perceptual difference
               between itching and pain. However, it was still unclear how our
               brains distinguish itching from pain. Thus, by functional
               magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series analysis, we
               investigated the neural substrates of perceptual differences
               between itching and pain. The anterior cingulate cortex, the
               anterior insula, the basal ganglia and the pre-supplementary
               motor area were commonly activated by itching and pain. Neural
               activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the
               posterior insula associated with itching was significantly
               higher than that associated with pain and significantly
               proportional to itching sensation. Pain, but not itching,
               induced an activation of the thalamus for several minutes, and
               neural activity of this brain region significantly correlated to
               pain sensation. These findings demonstrate that the difference
               in the sensitivity of PCC, the posterior insula and the thalamus
               between itching and pain would be responsible for the perceptual
               difference between these sensations. The previous itching
               studies did not observe an activation of the secondary
               somatosensory cortex (S2) by itching. However, we observed that
               an activation of S2 by pain was not significantly different from
               that by itching, indicating that S2 was associated with not only

               The significant increases of regional cerebral blood flow caused

               stimulus, corresponding to the previous imaging studies
               concerning itching. Activation in these areas related to itching
               stimuli was decreased by a simultaneous stimulation of itching
               and cold pain (the dual stimuli), as compared to itching alone.
               Interestingly, the midbrain, including periaqueductal gray

               networks processing itch sensation have used histamine as the
               sole itch inducer. In contrast with histamine, cowhage-induced
               itch is mediated via proteinase activated receptors PAR2 and is
               transmitted through a separate spinothalamic pathway, therefore
               imaging the brain activation evoked by cowhage could provide
               further insight into central processing of itch. We report for

               analyzed in contrast with histamine-induced itch. We also
               explored the brain responses induced by histamine and cowhage
               combined in a tight sequence. The results of our analyses
               obtained in a group of 15 healthy volunteers suggested that
               cowhage and histamine co-activated a core group of brain
               structures, while also revealing notable differences. Core areas
               activated by both stimuli were found in the thalamus, primary
               and secondary somatosensory cortices, posterior parietal cortex,
               superior and middle temporal cortices, PCC, ACC, precuneus and

               involvement of the insular cortex, claustrum, basal ganglia,
               putamen, thalamic nuclei and pulvinar. The differences observed

               correlations between itch intensity and the patterns in brain
               activation were explored. Our analysis revealed that the most
               significant differences between cowhage and histamine itch were
               not affected by stimulus intensity, although a subset of regions
               displayed activations which were intensity-dependent. The
               combined application of cowhage and histamine highlighted the
               role of insula and claustrum in the processing of both itch
               modalities in the same time. The present results suggest the
               existence of overlapping but also distinct neuronal networks

              as transducers for both. A key difference between these
              sensations is that itch is initiated by irritation of the skin,
              whereas pain can be elicited from almost anywhere in the body;
              thus, itch may be encoded by the selective activation of specific
              subsets of neurons that are tuned to detect harmful stimuli at
              the surface and have specialized central connectivity that is
              specific to itch. Within the spinal cord, cross-modal inhibition

               brain stem structure called the parabrachial nucleus. Inhibition

               itch sensation is an important protective mechanism for animals,
               chronic itch remains a challenging clinical problem. Itch
               processing has been studied extensively at the spinal level.

               what central circuits underlie the itch-induced scratching
               behavior remain largely unknown. We found that the
               spinoparabrachial pathway was activated during itch processing
               and that optogenetic suppression of this pathway impaired
               itch-induced scratching behaviors. Itch-mediating spinal
               neurons, which express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor,
               are disynaptically connected to the parabrachial nucleus via

              that gastrin-releasing peptide is specifically expressed in a
              small subset of peptidergic dorsal root ganglion neurons, whereas
              expression of its receptor GRPR is restricted to lamina I of the

              intervention in an interactive, closed-loop manner. But this
              raises the question as to whether the brain activity changes as a
              function of this interaction. Here, we used real-time decoded
              functional MRI responses from the insula cortex as input into a
              closed-loop control system aimed at reducing pain and looked for
              co-adaptive neural and behavioral changes. As subjects engaged in
              active cognitive strategies orientated toward the control system,
              such as trying to enhance their brain activity, pain encoding in
              the insula was paradoxically degraded. From a mechanistic
              perspective, we found that cognitive engagement was accompanied
              by activation of the endogenous pain modulation system,
              manifested by the attentional modulation of pain ratings and
              enhanced pain responses in pregenual anterior cingulate cortex

              endogenous modulation was confirmed in a second experiment using
              an EEG-based closed-loop system. Overall, the results show that
              implementing brain-machine control systems for pain induces a
              parallel set of co-adaptive changes in the brain, and this can
              interfere with the brain signals and behavior under control. More
              generally, this illustrates a fundamental challenge of brain
              decoding applications-that the brain inherently adapts to being
              decoded, especially as a result of cognitive processes related to
              learning and cooperation. Understanding the nature of these
              co-adaptive processes informs strategies to mitigate or exploit

              examine the similarites and differences in brain processing of
              visceral and somatic pain, one of the most fundamental
              distinctions in the pain field. We analyze data from 7 fMRI
              studies (N = 165) and 5 types of pain and
              discomfort---esophageal, gastric, and rectal distension,
              cutaneous thermal stimulation, and vulvar pressure---to establish
              and validate generalizable pain representations. We first
              evaluate an established multivariate brain measure, the
              Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS), as a potential common
              nociceptive pain system across all pain types. Then, we develop a
              multivariate classifier for visceral vs. somatic pain. The NPS
              (1) responded robustly in 98\% of participants across all types,
              (2) correlated with perceived intensity of visceral
              pain/discomfort, and (3) showed specificity to pain when compared
              with non-painful cognitive and affective conditions drawn from 12
              additional studies (total N = 180, AUROC 0.93). Pre-defined
              signatures for other types of negative affect did not respond to
              visceral pain. The novel visceral vs. somatic classifier reliably

              stimulation in both cross-validation and independent cohorts
              (AUROC 0.84). Other types reflected mixtures of somatic and
              visceral patterns. These results validate the NPS as measuring a
              common core nociceptive pain system across pain types, and lay a
              foundation for new brain-based biomarkers for particular types of

               the parahippocampal cortex and retrosplenial cortex, and an
               anterior temporal (AT) system that includes the perirhinal
               cortex. This ``PMAT'' framework accounts for differences in the
               anatomical and functional connectivity of the medial temporal
               lobes, which may underpin differences in cognitive function
               between the systems. The PM and AT systems make distinct
               contributions to memory and to other cognitive domains, and
               convergent findings suggest that they are involved in processing
               information about contexts and items, respectively. In order to
               support the full complement of memory-guided behavior, the two
               systems must interact, and the hippocampal and ventromedial
               prefrontal cortex may serve as sites of integration between the

              between how an ongoing activity is perceptually segmented into
              events and how those events are remembered a few seconds later.
              In several studies, participants watched movie clips that
              presented objects in the context of goal-directed activities.
              Five seconds after an object was presented, the clip paused for a
              recognition test. Performance on the recognition test depended on
              the occurrence of perceptual event boundaries. Objects that were
              present when an event boundary occurred were better recognized
              than other objects, suggesting that event boundaries structure
              the contents of memory. This effect was strongest when an
              object's type was tested but was also observed for objects'
              perceptual features. Memory also depended on whether an event

              gathered from subjects watching an episode of BBCs Sherlock (Chen

              responses and natural language representations. By leveraging
              data from multiple subjects watching the same movie, we were able
              to perform scene classification with 72\% accuracy (random
              guessing would give 4\%) and scene ranking with average rank in
              the top 4\% (random guessing would give 50\%). The key
              ingredients underlying this high level of performance are (a) the
              use of the Shared Response Model (SRM) and its variant SRM-ICA
              (Chen et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016) to aggregate fMRI data

              geometric organization of the semantic space of emotion-have
              sparked intense debate. Here we introduce a conceptual framework
              to analyze reported emotional states elicited by 2,185 short
              videos, examining the richest array of reported emotional
              experiences studied to date and the extent to which reported
              experiences of emotion are structured by discrete and dimensional
              geometries. Across self-report methods, we find that the videos
              reliably elicit 27 distinct varieties of reported emotional
              experience. Further analyses revealed that categorical labels
              such as amusement better capture reports of subjective experience
              than commonly measured affective dimensions (e.g., valence and
              arousal). Although reported emotional experiences are represented

               its prevalence in media psychology, limited work has examined
               suspense from a media neuroscience perspective, and thus the
               biological underpinnings of suspense remain unknown. Here we
               examine continuous brain responses of 494 viewers watching a
               suspenseful movie. To create a time-resolved measure of the
               degree to which a movie aligns audience-wide brain responses, we
               computed dynamic inter-subject correlations of functional
               magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series among all viewers
               using sliding-window analysis. In parallel, we captured
               in-the-moment reports of suspense in an independent sample via

               inter-subject correlations over the course of the movie tracked

  abstract = "Communication requires the abilities to generate and interpret
              utterances and to infer the beliefs, desires, and goals of others
              (``Theory of Mind''; ToM). These two abilities have been shown to
              dissociate: individuals with aphasia retain the ability to think
              about others' mental states; and individuals with autism are
              impaired in social reasoning, but their basic language processing
              is often intact. In line with this evidence from brain disorders,
              functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown that linguistic and ToM
              abilities recruit distinct sets of brain regions. And yet,
              language is a social tool that allows us to share thoughts with
              one another. Thus, the language and ToM brain networks must share
              information despite being implemented in distinct neural
              circuits. Here, we investigated potential interactions between
              these networks during naturalistic cognition using functional
              correlations in fMRI. The networks were functionally defined in
              individual participants, in terms of preference for sentences
              over nonwords for language, and for belief inference over
              physical-event processing for ToM, with both a verbal and a
              nonverbal paradigm. Although, across experiments, interregion
              correlations within each network were higher than between-network
              correlations, we also observed above-baseline synchronization of
              blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations between the
              two networks during rest and story comprehension. This
              synchronization was functionally specific: neither network was
              synchronized with the executive control network (functionally
              defined in terms of preference for a harder over easier version
              of an executive task). Thus, coordination between the language

              abilities to communicate linguistically and to infer others'
              mental states. Although linguistic and social abilities appear to
              be interlinked onto- and phylogenetically, they are dissociated
              in the adult human brain. Yet successful communication requires
              language and social reasoning to work in concert. Using
              functional MRI, we show that language regions are synchronized

              children. In addition, task-based and resting state experiments

              both of these challenges through use of naturalistic viewing
              (i.e., passively watching a movie in the scanner) combined with
              inter-subject neural synchrony to examine functional
              specialization within 4- and 6-year old children. Using a novel

              attention while viewing film narratives are poorly understood. In
              fact, many film theorists and practitioners disagree on whether
              the film stimulus (bottom-up) or the viewer (top-down) is more
              important in determining how we watch movies. Reading research
              has shown a strong connection between eye movements and
              comprehension, and scene perception studies have shown strong
              effects of viewing tasks on eye movements, but such idiosyncratic
              top-down control of gaze in film would be anathema to the
              universal control mainstream filmmakers typically aim for. Thus,
              in two experiments we tested whether the eye movements and
              comprehension relationship similarly held in a classic film
              example, the famous opening scene of Orson Welles' Touch of Evil
              (Welles \& Zugsmith, Touch of Evil, 1958). Comprehension
              differences were compared with more volitionally controlled
              task-based effects on eye movements. To investigate the effects
              of comprehension on eye movements during film viewing, we
              manipulated viewers' comprehension by starting participants at
              different points in a film, and then tracked their eyes. Overall,
              the manipulation created large differences in comprehension, but
              only produced modest differences in eye movements. To amplify
              top-down effects on eye movements, a task manipulation was
              designed to prioritize peripheral scene features: a map task.
              This task manipulation created large differences in eye movements
              when compared to participants freely viewing the clip for
              comprehension. Thus, to allow for strong, volitional top-down
              control of eye movements in film, task manipulations need to make
              features that are important to narrative comprehension irrelevant
              to the viewing task. The evidence provided by this experimental
              case study suggests that filmmakers' belief in their ability to
              create systematic gaze behavior across viewers is confirmed, but
              that this does not indicate universally similar comprehension of
              the film narrative.",

  abstract  = "SummaryPeople routinely hear and understand speech at rates of
               120--200 words per minute [1, 2]. Thus, speech comprehension
               must involve rapid, online neural mechanisms that process words'
               meanings in an approximately time-locked fashion. However,
               electrophysiological evidence for such time-locked processing
               has been lacking for continuous speech. Although valuable
               insights into semantic processing have been provided by the
               ``N400 component'' of the event-related potential [3--6], this
               literature has been dominated by paradigms using incongruous
               words within specially constructed sentences, with less emphasis
               on natural, narrative speech comprehension. Building on the
               discovery that cortical activity ``tracks'' the dynamics of
               running speech [7--9] and psycholinguistic work demonstrating
               [10--12] and modeling [13--15] how context impacts on word
               processing, we describe a new approach for deriving an
               electrophysiological correlate of natural speech comprehension.
               We used a computational model [16] to quantify the meaning
               carried by words based on how semantically dissimilar they were
               to their preceding context and then regressed this measure
               against electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from
               subjects as they listened to narrative speech. This produced a
               prominent negativity at a time lag of 200--600 ms on
               centro-parietal EEG channels, characteristics common to the
               N400. Applying this approach to EEG datasets involving
               time-reversed speech, cocktail party attention, and audiovisual
               speech-in-noise demonstrated that this response was very
               sensitive to whether or not subjects understood the speech they
               heard. These findings demonstrate that, when successfully
               comprehending natural speech, the human brain responds to the
               contextual semantic content of each word in a relatively
               time-locked fashion.",

              activities, the brain has to integrate information over multiple
              time scales. We recently proposed that the brain uses similar
              strategies for integrating information across space and over
              time. Drawing a parallel with spatial receptive fields, we
              defined the temporal receptive window (TRW) of a cortical
              microcircuit as the length of time before a response during which
              sensory information may affect that response. Our previous
              findings in the visual system are consistent with the hypothesis
              that TRWs become larger when moving from low-level sensory to
              high-level perceptual and cognitive areas. In this study, we
              mapped TRWs in auditory and language areas by measuring fMRI
              activity in subjects listening to a real-life story scrambled at
              the time scales of words, sentences, and paragraphs. Our results
              revealed a hierarchical topography of TRWs. In early auditory
              cortices (A1+), brain responses were driven mainly by the
              momentary incoming input and were similarly reliable across all
              scrambling conditions. In areas with an intermediate TRW,
              coherent information at the sentence time scale or longer was
              necessary to evoke reliable responses. At the apex of the TRW
              hierarchy, we found parietal and frontal areas that responded
              reliably only when intact paragraphs were heard in a meaningful
              sequence. These results suggest that the time scale of processing

              and occasionally attempted to retrieve from memory objects that
              recently appeared in the film. The delay between object
              presentation and test was always 5 sec. Critically, for some of

              examine this issue, we measured fMRI activity while observers
              viewed a novel TV sitcom. Three weeks later, subsequent memory
              (SM) for the narrative content of movie events was assessed. We
              analyzed the encoding data for intersubject correlations (ISC)
              based on subjects' subsequent memory (ISC-SM) performance to
              identify brain regions whose BOLD response is significantly more
              correlated across subjects during portions of the movie that are
              successfully as compared to unsuccessfully encoded. These regions
              include the parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus,
              anterior temporal poles, and the temporal-parietal junction.
              Further analyses reveal (1) that these correlated regions can
              display distinct activation profiles and (2) that the results
              seen with the ISC-SM analysis are complementary to more
              traditional linear models and allow analysis of complex time
              course data. Thus, the ISC-SM analysis extends traditional
              subsequent memory findings to a rich, dynamic and more

              remember narrative texts. We use the term script to refer to
              these action stereotypes. Two studies collected script norms:
              people described what goes on in detail during familiar
              activities. They largely agreed on the nature of the characters,
              props, actions, and the order of the actions. They also agreed on
              how to segment the low-level action sequences into constituent
              ``scenes,'' suggesting a hierarchical organization in memory of
              the activity. Other studies investigated memory for a text
              narrating actions from a script. Subjects tended to confuse in
              memory actions that were stated with unstated actions implied by
              the script. This tendency increased as more related script
              instances were studied. Subjects also preferred to recall script
              actions in their familiar order; a scrambled text that presented
              some script actions out of order tended to be recalled in

              novel information into long-term memory by binding, reactivating,
              and strengthening distributed cortical-cortical connections.
              Recent studies implicate a key role in this process for
              hippocampally driven crosstalk with the (ventro)medial prefrontal
              cortex (vmPFC), which is proposed to become a central node in
              such representational networks over time. The existence of a
              relevant prior associative network, or schema, may moreover
              facilitate this process. Thus, hippocampal-vmPFC crosstalk may
              support integration of new memories, particularly in the absence
              of a relevant prior schema. To address this issue, we used
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and prior schema
              manipulation to track hippocampal-vmPFC connectivity during
              encoding and postencoding rest. We manipulated prior schema
              knowledge by exposing 30 participants to the first part of a
              movie that was temporally scrambled for 15 participants. The next
              day, participants underwent fMRI while encoding the movie's final
              15 min in original order and, subsequently, while resting. Schema
              knowledge and item recognition performance show that prior schema
              was successfully and selectively manipulated. Intersubject
              synchronization (ISS) and interregional partial correlation
              analyses furthermore show that stronger prior schema was
              associated with more vmPFC ISS and less hippocampal-vmPFC
              interregional connectivity during encoding. Notably, this
              connectivity pattern persisted during postencoding rest. These
              findings suggest that additional crosstalk between hippocampus
              and vmPFC is required to compensate for difficulty integrating
              novel information during encoding and provide tentative support
              for the notion that functionally relevant hippocampal-neocortical
              crosstalk persists during off-line periods after learning.",

              hieroglyphics, from the Bayeux Tapestry to modern day comic books
              (Kunzle, 1973; McCloud, 1993). Yet not much research has
              addressed the structure and comprehension of narrative images,
              for example, how do people create meaning out of sequential
              images? This piece helps fill the gap by presenting a theory of
              Narrative Grammar. We describe the basic narrative categories and
              their relationship to a canonical narrative arc, followed by a
              discussion of complex structures that extend beyond the canonical
              schema. This demands that the canonical arc be reconsidered as a
              generative schema whereby any narrative category can be expanded
              into a node in a tree structure. Narrative ``pacing'' is
              interpreted as a reflection of various patterns of this
              embedding: conjunction, left-branching trees, center-embedded
              constituencies, and others. Following this, diagnostic methods
              are proposed for testing narrative categories and constituency.
              Finally, we outline the applicability of this theory beyond
              sequential images, such as to film and verbal discourse, and

               weak. Listening to each of the speeches induced similar neural
               response time courses, as measured by inter-subject correlation
               analysis, in widespread brain regions involved in spoken
               language processing. Crucially, alignment of the time course
               across listeners was stronger for rhetorically powerful
               speeches, especially for bilateral regions of the superior
               temporal gyri and medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, during
               powerful speeches, listeners as a group are more coupled to each
               other, suggesting that powerful speeches are more potent in
               taking control of the listeners' brain responses. Weaker
               speeches were processed more heterogeneously, although they
               still prompted substantially correlated responses. These
               patterns of coupled neural responses bear resemblance to
               metaphors of resonance, which are often invoked in discussions
               of speech impact, and contribute to the literature on auditory
               attention under natural circumstances. Overall, this approach

               quantifiable variables and their effect on the viewer

               low-level features present within film: shot duration, shot
               structure, luminance, visual activity and color. Shot duration
               has meaningfully decreased with implications for visual
               momentum. Filmmakers use shot structure (the relative
               positioning of a shot with a particular duration to other shots
               within the film) to cater to shifts in viewers' attention to the
               film. On-screen activity is examined with regard to how viewers
               perceive tempo, shifts in time and space, and genre. Like
               activity, luminance affects viewer perception of the genre of a
               film, as well as within-film understanding of event boundaries.
               Color also assists in viewer perception of spatiotemporal
               shifts. The research in this chapter eschews the traditional
               view that low-level features are simply an artifact of the
               narrative; instead, it is unlikely that viewers would be able to
               fully understand or attend to the narrative without strategic

              using these to suggest new approaches to existing issues in

              produce, such as the sense of wonder induced by seeing an
              apparently impossible event. Third is the consideration of magic
              tricks-methods and effects together-as phenomena of scientific

              that value is reified in the brain, that is, that there are
              neurons or brain regions whose responses serve the discrete
              purpose of encoding value. This hypothesis is supported by the
              finding that the activity of many neurons and brain regions
              covaries with subjective value as estimated in specific tasks.
              Here we consider an alternative: that value is not represented in
              the brain. This idea is motivated by close consideration of the
              economic concept of value, which places important epistemic
              constraints on our ability to identify its neural basis. It is
              also motivated by the behavioral economics literature, especially

              reevaluate putative neural evidence for the representation of
              value, and explore an alternative: that brains directly learn
              action policies. We delineate how this alternative can provide a

              processing of future experiences. These two functions of memory
              are often at odds: Remembering specific experiences from the past
              requires storing idiosyncratic properties that define particular
              moments in space and time, but by definition such properties will
              not be shared with similar situations in the future and thus may

              faced with this conflict, the brain prioritizes prediction over
              encoding. Behavioral tests of recognition and source recall
              showed that items allowing for prediction of what will appear

              instantiates known properties of hippocampal projections and

              found that the monosynaptic pathway-the pathway connecting

              statistical learning, while the trisynaptic pathway-connecting

              individual episodes, with apparent representations of
              regularities resulting from associative reactivation through

  abstract = "It is well known that distributing study events over time leads
              to better memory over long time scales, compared with massing
              study events together. One explanation for such long-term
              resistance to forgetting is that distributed study leads to
              neural differentiation in memory, which supports retrieval of
              past experiences by disambiguating highly similar memory
              representations. Neuroanatomical models of episodic memory
              retrieval propose that the hippocampus and medial prefrontal
              cortex (MPFC) work together to enable retrieval of behaviorally
              appropriate memories. However, it is not known how
              representations in these regions jointly support resistance to
              forgetting long after initial learning. Using fMRI, we measured
              differentiation in retrieved memory representations following an
              extended delay in male and female human participants. After 1
              week, word-object associations were better remembered if studied
              across 2 d (overnight), allowing associations to be learned in
              distinct temporal contexts, compared with learning within a
              single day (same day). MPFC retrieval patterns showed
              differentiation for overnight relative to same day memories,
              whereas hippocampal patterns reflected associative retrieval
              success. Overnight memory differentiation in MPFC was higher for
              associative than item memories and higher than differentiation
              assessed over a brain-wide set of retrieval-active voxels. The
              memory-related difference in MPFC pattern differentiation
              correlated with memory success for overnight learning and with
              hippocampal-MPFC functional connectivity. These results show that
              learning information across days leads to differentiated MPFC
              memory representations, reducing forgetting after 1 week, and
              suggest this arises from persistent interactions between MPFC and
              hippocampus.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neural activity in both the
              hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) has been linked
              to memory-related representations, but prior work has not
              examined how these representations support episodic memory
              retrieval over extended time scales that are characteristic of
              everyday retrieval. We show that differentiation in MPFC activity
              1 week after encoding is higher for retrieved information learned
              across 2 d compared with within a single day. In hippocampus,
              differentiation was greater for detailed memory retrieval but was
              not influenced by whether information had been learned over 1 or
              2 d. Differentiation in MPFC predicted behavioral robustness to
              forgetting and was correlated with hippocampal-MPFC connectivity.
              The results suggest that context-based differentiation supports

              model-, feature- and biology-level assessments to provide
              complementary results that support the understanding of how and

               two opposing processing states: encoding and retrieval. When

               potential tradeoff between encoding the present and retrieving
               the past. This tradeoff may be resolved by memory
               integration-that is, by forming a mnemonic representation that
               links present experience with overlapping past experience. Here,
               we used fMRI decoding analyses to predict when - and establish
               how - past and present experiences become integrated in memory.
               In an initial experiment, we alternately instructed subjects to
               adopt encoding, retrieval or integration states during
               overlapping learning. We then trained across-subject pattern
               classifiers to 'read out' the instructed processing states from
               fMRI activity patterns. We show that an integration state was
               clearly dissociable from encoding or retrieval states. Moreover,

              STATEMENT The human brain cannot remember everything. Forgetting
              has a critical role in curating memories and discarding unwanted
              information. Intentional forgetting has traditionally been linked
              to passive processes, such as the withdrawal of sustained
              attention or a stoppage of memory rehearsal. It has also been
              linked to active suppression of memory processes during encoding
              and retrieval. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and
              machine-learning methods, we show new evidence that intentional
              forgetting involves an enhancement of memory processing in the
              sensory cortex to achieve desired forgetting of recent visual
              experiences. This enhancement temporarily boosts the activation
              of the memory representation and renders it vulnerable to
              disruption via homeostatic regulation. Contrary to intuition,
              deliberate forgetting may involve more rather than less attention

              rather that relatively independent neural systems appear to
              mediate different types of memory. Neurobiological studies, for
              instance, have identified separable cognitive or ``declarative''
              and stimulus-response ``habit'' memory systems that rely upon the
              medial temporal lobe (e.g. hippocampus) and basal ganglia (e.g.
              caudate-putamen), respectively. Evidence indicates that multiple
              memory systems are activated simultaneously and in parallel in
              various learning tasks, and recent findings suggest that these
              systems may interact. One form of interaction between medial
              temporal lobe and basal ganglia memory systems appears
              competitive in nature, and has been revealed in non-human animal
              studies in which damage to a given memory system results in
              enhanced learning. Recent human neuroimaging research has also
              provided evidence in favor of competition between memory systems.
              Thus, converging evidence across species supports the hypothesis

              level-dependent (BOLD) time series. We show that surprisingly,
              only a small fraction of frames exhibiting the strongest

               entorhinal cells form a basis describing structural knowledge,
               and hippocampal cells link this basis with sensory

              essential for appropriately learning which actions lead to reward

              of credit assignment is best explained by a Bayesian
              reinforcement learning model which posits that beliefs about the
              causal structure of the environment modulate reward prediction
              errors (RPEs) during action value updating. In this study, we
              investigated the neural circuits underlying reinforcement

              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while human participants (N =
              31; 13 males, 18 females) completed a behavioral task that
              manipulated beliefs about causal structure. We found evidence
              that RPEs modulated by causal beliefs are represented in
              posterior putamen, while standard (unmodulated) RPEs are
              represented in ventral striatum. Further analyses revealed that
              beliefs about causal structure are represented in anterior insula
              and inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, structural equation modeling
              revealed effective connectivity from anterior insula to posterior
              putamen. Together, these results are consistent with a neural
              architecture in which causal beliefs in anterior insula are
              integrated with prediction error signals in posterior putamen to
              update action values. Significance Statement Learning which
              actions lead to reward -- a process known as reinforcement
              learning -- is essential for survival. Inferring the causes of
              observed outcomes -- a process known as causal inference -- is
              crucial for appropriately assigning credit to one's own actions
              and restricting learning to effective action-outcome
              contingencies. Previous studies have linked reinforcement
              learning to the striatum and causal inference to prefrontal
              regions, yet how these neural processes interact to guide
              adaptive behavior remains poorly understood. Here, we found

              amnesia was examined. METHOD: A survey of the research on
              emotional trauma, learning, memory loss, glucocosteroid stress
              hormones, and the hippocampus was conducted, and animal and human
              studies were reviewed. RESULTS: It is well documented and has
              been experimentally demonstrated in animals and humans that
              prolonged and high levels of stress, fear, and arousal commonly
              induce learning deficits and memory loss ranging from the minimal
              to the profound. As stress and arousal levels dramatically
              increase, learning and memory deteriorate in accordance with the
              classic inverse U-shaped curve. These memory deficits are due to
              disturbances in hippocampal activation and arousal, and the
              corticosteroid secretion which can suppress neural activity
              associated with learning and memory and induce hippocampal
              atrophy. Risk and predisposing factors include a history of
              previous emotional trauma or neurological injury involving the
              temporal lobe and hippocampus, the repetitive and prolonged
              nature of the trauma, and age and individual differences in
              baseline arousal and level of cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: Although
              some victims may be unable to forget, amnesia or partial memory
              loss is not uncommon following severe stress and emotional
              trauma. Even well publicized national traumas may induce
              significant forgetting. Memory loss is a consequence of
              glucocosteroids and stress-induced disturbances involving the

              lead to integration of old and new memories and strengthen
              long-term retention. Additionally, congruency with prior

              influence learning in an educational context. In two experiments,
              we investigated this question using an AB-AC inference paradigm
              where students were asked to first study an AB (word-picture) and
              then an AC-association (word-description). BC-associations were

              human participants (male and female) watching a 50 min movie and

              event boundaries, during a 50 min movie viewing triggers the
              rapid memory reactivation of the just-encoded event to promote
              its successful encoding into long-term memory. By finding that
              memory reactivation, a neural mechanism critical for episodic

              features have changed. Thus, to adaptively use memory to guide
              perception, one needs to retrieve relevant memories and also to
              register differences between remembered and current events. Event
              Memory Retrieval and Comparison Theory proposes that observers
              associatively activate memories of related previous episodes, and
              that this guides their ongoing perception. Conflicts between
              previous and current event features can hurt immediate
              performance, but if changes are registered and encoded they can
              lead to highly effective encoding of the prior event, current
              event, and their relationship. Disruption of these mechanisms
              could play a role in older adults' greater susceptibility to
              event memory interference. Two experiments tested these
              hypotheses by asking participants to watch movies depicting two
              fictive days of an actor. Some activities were repeated across
              days, others were repeated with a changed feature (e.g., waking

              participants completed a cued-recall test. Changes that

              model. The central concept of their model is fear of pain.
              'Confrontation' and 'avoidance' are postulated as the two extreme
              responses to this fear, of which the former leads to the
              reduction of fear over time. The latter, however, leads to the
              maintenance or exacerbation of fear, possibly generating a phobic
              state. In the last decade, an increasing number of investigations
              have corroborated and refined the fear-avoidance model. The aim
              of this paper is to review the existing evidence for the
              mediating role of pain-related fear, and its immediate and
              long-term consequences in the initiation and maintenance of
              chronic pain disability. We first highlight possible precursors
              of pain-related fear including the role negative appraisal of
              internal and external stimuli, negative affectivity and anxiety
              sensitivity may play. Subsequently, a number of fear-related
              processes will be discussed including escape and avoidance
              behaviors resulting in poor behavioral performance,
              hypervigilance to internal and external illness information,
              muscular reactivity, and physical disuse in terms of

              are trained to upregulate their amygdalar hemodynamic responses
              during positive autobiographical memory recall with real-time
              functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf)

              and negative stimuli in a variety of behavioral and imaging
              tasks. METHODS: Patients with major depressive disorder completed
              two rtfMRI-nf sessions (18 received amygdalar rtfMRI-nf, 16
              received control parietal rtfMRI-nf). One week before and
              following rtfMRI-nf training, participants performed tasks
              measuring responses to emotionally valenced stimuli including a
              backward-masking task, which measures the amygdalar hemodynamic
              response to emotional faces presented for traditionally
              subliminal duration and followed by a mask, and the Emotional
              Test Battery in which reaction times and performance accuracy are
              measured during tasks involving emotional faces and words.
              RESULTS: During the backward-masking task, amygdalar responses
              increased while viewing masked happy faces but decreased to
              masked sad faces in the experimental versus control group
              following rtfMRI-nf. During the Emotional Test Battery, reaction
              times decreased to identification of positive faces and during
              self-identification with positive words and vigilance scores
              increased to positive faces and decreased to negative faces
              during the faces dot-probe task in the experimental versus
              control group following rtfMRI-nf. CONCLUSIONS: rtfMRI-nf
              training to increase the amygdalar hemodynamic response to
              positive memories was associated with changes in amygdalar
              responses to happy and sad faces and improved processing of
              positive stimuli during performance of the Emotional Test
              Battery. These results may suggest that amygdalar rtfMRI-nf

              similar to antidepressant pharmacotherapy.",

              Least Squares Regression (PLSR). The most popular (by far)

              varieties based on the type of data that are related to brain
              activity: behavior PLSC analyzes the relationship between brain
              activity and behavioral data, task PLSC analyzes how brain
              activity relates to pre-defined categories or experimental
              design, seed PLSC analyzes the pattern of connectivity between
              brain regions, and multi-block or multi-table PLSC integrates one
              or more of these varieties in a common analysis. PLSR, in
              contrast to PLSC, is a predictive technique which, typically,
              predicts behavior (or design) from brain activity. For both PLS
              methods, statistical inferences are implemented using

              we used an emotional learning task designed to measure
              recognition memory for category exemplars encoded during
              competing experiences of fear-conditioning and extinction. Here
              we show that people recognized more fear-conditioned exemplars

              encoded immediately after a perceptual event boundary separating
              conditioning from extinction. Selective episodic memory depended
              on a period of consolidation, an explicit break between competing
              experiences, and was unrelated to within-session arousal or the
              explicit realization of a transition from conditioning to
              extinction. Collectively, these findings suggest that event

              information experienced shortly thereafter. We put forward a

              shifts in context, or event boundaries, can influence how those
              events come to be represented in memory [1-4]. Specifically,
              mnemonic binding across sequential representations is more
              challenging at context shifts, such that successful temporal
              associations are more likely to be formed within than across
              contexts [1, 2, 5-9]. However, in order to preserve a subjective
              sense of continuity, it is important that the memory system
              bridge temporally adjacent events, even if they occur in
              seemingly distinct contexts. Here, we used pattern similarity
              analysis to scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during
              a sequential learning task [2, 3] in humans and showed that the
              detection of event boundaries triggered a rapid memory
              reinstatement of the just-encoded sequence episode. Memory
              reactivation was detected rapidly (∼200-800 ms from the onset of
              the event boundary) and was specific to context shifts that were
              preceded by an event sequence with episodic content. Memory
              reinstatement was not observed during the sequential encoding of

              focused on how and when individuals perceive natural breakpoints,
              or boundaries, in ongoing experience. More recent research has
              examined how these boundaries modulate brain mechanisms that
              support long-term episodic memory. This work has revealed that a
              complex interplay between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex
              promotes the integration and separation of sequential information
              to help organize our experiences into mnemonic events. Here, we
              discuss how both temporal stability and change in one's thoughts,
              goals, and surroundings may provide scaffolding for these neural

              behavioral studies, we introduced context shifts (or ``event
              boundaries'') between trains of stimuli and then examined the
              influence of the boundaries on several measures of associative
              memory. In Experiment 1, we found that perceptual event
              boundaries strengthened associative binding of item-context
              pairings present at event boundaries. In Experiment 2, we
              observed reduced temporal order memory for items encoded in
              distinct events relative to items encoded within the same event,
              and a trade-off between the speed of processing at boundaries,
              and temporal order memory for items that flanked those

              there has been a major schism among theories of hippocampal
              function over this time. Some researchers argue that the
              hippocampus plays a broad role in episodic and declarative
              memory, whereas others argue for a specific role in the creation
              of spatial cognitive maps and navigation. Although both views
              have merit, neither provides a complete account of hippocampal
              function. Guided by recent reviews that attempt to bridge between
              these views, here we suggest that reconciliation can be
              accomplished by exploring hippocampal function from the
              perspective of Tolman's (1948) original conception of a cognitive
              map as organizing experience and guiding behavior across all
              domains of cognition. We emphasize recent studies in animals and
              humans showing that hippocampal networks support a broad range of
              domains of cognitive maps, that these networks organize specific
              experiences within the contextually relevant map, and that
              network activity patterns reflect behavior guided through
              cognitive maps. These results are consistent with a framework
              that bridges theories of hippocampal function by conceptualizing
              the hippocampus as organizing incoming information within the
              context of a multidimensional cognitive map of spatial, temporal,
              and associational context. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Research of
              hippocampal function is dominated by two major views. The spatial
              view argues that the hippocampus tracks routes through space,
              whereas the memory view suggests a broad role in declarative
              memory. Both views rely on considerable evidence, but neither
              provides a complete account of hippocampal function. Here we
              review evidence that, in addition to spatial context, the
              hippocampus encodes a wide variety of information about temporal
              and situational context, about the systematic organization of
              events in abstract space, and about routes through maps of
              cognition and space. We argue that these findings cross the
              boundaries of the memory and spatial views and offer new insights
              into hippocampal function as a system supporting a broad range of
              cognitive maps.",

              excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following
              inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively.
              Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation
              pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally
              coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple
              presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different
              stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal
              representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band
              synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation
              selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment
              creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that
              are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit
              the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The

              distinctiveness or highlight common elements. These fundamentally
              different kinds of memory representations may be instantiated in

              differentiated codes on the one hand, or integrated relational
              codes on the other. After reviewing empirical support for these

              formed and stored, we argue that distinct hippocampal regions

              transmit them to distinct cortical networks. Then focusing on
              when memories are formed, we identify several factors that can
              open and maintain specialized time windows, during which the very
              same hippocampal network is biased toward one coding scheme over
              the others. Specifically, we discuss evidence for (1)
              excitability-mediated integration windows, maintained by
              persistently elevated CREB levels following encoding of a

               describes a metacognitive aspect of consciousness wherein
               higher-order thought is directed through attentional focus on
               the self-object and self-related matters. This chapter explores
               the insights gained from neuroimaging studies into the brain
               substrates and mechanisms underlying such ``high-level''
               self-referential processing. At another level, selfhood is
               reflected in self-recognition processes which discriminate
               self-related stimuli from other similar stimuli. Here, we
               examine the relevant neuroimaging evidence, focusing on
               self-face recognition as an exemplar. At a more fundamental
               level, we review what is known about the mental representation
               of the body, focusing on studies suggesting that a primary sense
               of self is ultimately derived from the neural representation of
               the body via interoception. These studies emphasize the
               continuous mapping of dynamic changes in internal state, whereby
               physiological demands and homeostatic imperatives dictate
               motivations and shape the contents of cognition. Here,
               converging neuroimaging evidence suggests that brain regions
               involved in representing internal physiological processes and
               making them available to conscious appraisal contribute to
               self-referential cognitions. This link is further apparent in
               the neural correlates of cognitive control and detachment
               techniques, such as mindfulness, that increasingly find clinical
               utility. Ultimately, inferences from neuroimaging regarding
               selfhood and self-awareness must cohere with evidence from
               lesion studies and with an increasingly sophisticated
               understanding of the brain as a connected network generating
               self-representations via a range of overlapping mechanisms.

              associated with the generation of emotions needed to guide

  abstract = "Background: The ability to self-report on affective experience is
              essential to both our everyday communication about emotion and
              our scientific understanding of it. However, the underlying
              cognitive and neural mechanisms for how people construct
              statements even as simple as ``I feel bad!'' remain unclear. We
              examined whether the neural architecture underlying the ability
              to make statements about affective experience is composed of
              distinct functional systems. Methods: In a novel functional
              magnetic neuroimaging paradigm, 20 participants were shown images
              varying in affective intensity; they were required either to
              attend to and judge the affective response versus to nonaffective
              aspects of the stimulus and either to categorize their response
              into a verbal label or report on a scale that did not require
              verbal labeling. Results: We found that the ability to report on
              affective states involves (at least) three separable systems, one
              for directing attention to the affective response and making
              attributions about it that involves the dorsomedial prefrontal
              cortex, one for categorizing the response into a verbal label or
              word that involves the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and one
              sensitive to the intensity of the affective response including
              the ventral anterior insula and amygdala. Conclusions: These
              results suggest that unified statements about affective
              experience rely on integrating information from several distinct
              neural systems. Results are discussed in the context of how

              neural structures to enhance their detection. Here we consider
              that a critical function of the human amygdala is to enhance the
              perception of stimuli that have emotional significance. Under
              conditions of limited attention for normal perceptual
              awareness-that is, the attentional blink-we show that healthy
              observers demonstrate robust benefits for the perception of
              verbal stimuli of aversive content compared with stimuli of
              neutral content. In contrast, a patient with bilateral amygdala
              damage has no enhanced perception for such aversive stimulus
              events. Examination of patients with either left or right
              amygdala resections shows that the enhanced perception of
              aversive words depends specifically on the left amygdala. All
              patients comprehend normally the affective meaning of the

              platforms while avoiding incorrect platforms. To manipulate
              motivational states participants were either rewarded for

              navigating to incorrect platforms (avoidance). Participants' skin

              investigate the role of physiological arousal in motivated
              learning. Behavioral results revealed that, overall, approach
              motivation enhanced and avoidance motivation impaired memory

              evaluative judgments or engages in a task, positive affect can

  abstract = "So-called ``naturalistic'' stimuli have risen in popularity in
              cognitive, social, and affective psychology and neuroscience over
              the last 15 years. However, a critical property of these stimuli
              is frequently overlooked: Media---like film, television, books,
              and podcasts---are fundamentally not natural. They are
              deliberately crafted products meant to elicit particular human
              thought, emotion, and behavior. Given the rich history of
              scholarship on media as an art and science, subsuming media
              stimuli under the term ``naturalistic'' in psychological and
              brain sciences is inaccurate and obfuscates the advantages that
              media stimuli offer because they are artificial. Here, we argue
              for a more informed approach to adopting media stimuli in
              naturalistic paradigms. We empirically review how researchers
              currently describe and justify their choice of stimuli for a
              given experiment and present strategies to improve rigor in the
              stimulus selection process. We assert that experiencing media
              should be considered a task akin to any other experimental
              task(s), and explain how this shift in perspective will compel
              more nuanced and generalizable research using these stimuli.
              Throughout, we offer theoretical and practical knowledge from
              multidisciplinary media research to raise the standard for the
              treatment of media stimuli in psychological and neuroscientific

               used cognitive strategies to regulate craving for cigarettes and

               associated with (i) activity in regions previously associated
               with regulating emotion in particular and cognitive control in
               general, including dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral

              faces from objects, can be achieved without OFA, perhaps via the
              direct connections to the fusiform face area (FFA) from several
              extrastriate cortical areas. Some lesion, transcranial magnetic
              stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (fMRI) findings argue against a strict feed-forward hierarchical
              model of face perception, in which the OFA is the principal and
              common source of input for other visual and non-visual cortical
              regions involved in face perception, including the FFA,
              face-selective superior temporal sulcus and somatosensory cortex.
              Instead, these findings point to a more interactive model in
              which higher-level face perception abilities depend on the
              interplay between several functionally and anatomically distinct
              neural regions. Furthermore, the nature of these interactions may
              depend on the particular demands of the task. We review the

              and distributed nature of face processing.",

  abstract = "During communication, we perceive and express emotional
              information through many different channels, including facial
              expressions, prosody, body motion, and posture. Although
              historically the human body has been perceived primarily as a
              tool for actions, there is now increased understanding that the
              body is also an important medium for emotional expression.
              Indeed, research on emotional body language is rapidly emerging
              as a new field in cognitive and affective neuroscience. This
              article reviews how whole-body signals are processed and
              understood, at the behavioral and neural levels, with specific
              reference to their role in emotional communication. The first
              part of this review outlines brain regions and spectrotemporal
              dynamics underlying perception of isolated neutral and affective
              bodies, the second part details the contextual effects on body
              emotion recognition, and final part discusses body processing on
              a subconscious level. More specifically, research has shown that
              body expressions as compared with neutral bodies draw upon a
              larger network of regions responsible for action observation and
              preparation, emotion processing, body processing, and integrative
              processes. Results from neurotypical populations and masking
              paradigms suggest that subconscious processing of affective
              bodies relies on a specific subset of these regions. Moreover,
              recent evidence has shown that emotional information from the
              face, voice, and body all interact, with body motion and posture
              often highlighting and intensifying the emotion expressed in the

  abstract = "In the highly social life of humans, rewards that are sought and
              experienced are intertwined with social relationships and
              interactions between people. Just as we value nonsocial rewards
              such as food or money, we also value social outcomes (e.g.,
              praise from a superior). We use social information to evaluate
              and form expectations of others and to make decisions involving
              others. Here we review research demonstrating how the neural
              circuitry of reward, particularly the striatum, is also involved
              in processing social information and making decisions in social
              situations. This research provides an understanding of the neural
              basis for social behavior from the perspective of how we evaluate
              social experiences and how our social interactions and decisions
              are motivated. We review research addressing the common neural
              systems underlying evaluation of social and nonsocial rewards.
              The human striatum, known to play a key role in reward
              processing, displays signals related to a broad spectrum of
              social functioning, including evaluating social rewards, making
              decisions influenced by social factors, learning about social
              others, cooperating, competing, and following social norms. WIREs

               when it is needed most. Resulting empathic failures precipitate
               and worsen social conflict. Accordingly, conflict-reduction
               interventions prioritize developing empathy in order to achieve
               harmony. Recent research has indicated that such interventions
               can benefit from a more nuanced understanding of empathy. First,
               empathy is a multidimensional construct, including
               understanding, sharing, and feeling concern for others?
               emotions. The expression of these empathic processes is further
               influenced by psychological factors that ?tune? people toward or
               away from empathy. Interventions must therefore diagnose the
               specific nature and precursors of empathic failures and tailor
               interventions appropriately. Second, empathy alone may be
               insufficient to produce prosocial behavior, especially when
               parties differ in status or power. In these cases, interventions
               should promote equitable goals and norms in addition to empathy.
               By understanding its component processes and boundary
               conditions, practitioners can work to promote empathy in

              Although existing explanations for this effect focus on

              disparities in the allocation of resources. Studies 1 and 2

              as ``Black'' as opposed to ``White.'' In studies 3 and 4,

  abstract = "When people have the chance to help others at a cost to
              themselves, are cooperative decisions driven by intuition or
              reflection? To answer this question, recent studies have tested
              the relationship between reaction times (RTs) and cooperation,
              reporting both positive and negative correlations. To reconcile
              this apparent contradiction, we argue that decision conflict
              (rather than the use of intuition vs. reflection) drives response
              times, leading to an inverted-U shaped relationship between RT
              and cooperation. Studies 1 through 3 show that intermediate
              decisions take longer than both extremely selfish and extremely
              cooperative decisions. Studies 4 and 5 find that the conflict
              between self-interested and cooperative motives explains
              individual differences in RTs. Manipulating conflictedness causes
              longer RTs and more intermediate decisions, and RTs mediate the
              relationship between conflict and intermediate decisions.
              Finally, Studies 6 and 7 demonstrate that conflict is distinct
              from reflection by manipulating the use of intuition (vs.
              reflection). Experimentally promoting reliance on intuition
              increases cooperation, but has no effects on decision extremity
              or feelings of conflictedness. In sum, we provide evidence that
              RTs should not be interpreted as a direct proxy for the use of
              intuitive or reflective processes, and dissociate the effects of
              conflict and reflection in social decision making.",

              of social fear learning, and the neural mechanisms are beginning
              to be understood. We review research suggesting that an
              amygdala-centered model of fear conditioning can help to explain
              social learning of fear through observation and instruction. We
              also describe how observational and instructed fear is
              distinguished by involvement of additional neural systems
              implicated in social-emotional behavior, language and explicit
              memory, and propose a modified conditioning model to account for
              social fear learning. A better understanding of social fear
              learning promotes integration of biological principles of
              learning with cultural evolution.",

              randomized, controlled trial involving patients with
              long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we
              compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective
              serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were
              assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of
              psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo
              (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3
              weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram
              group); all the patients received psychological support. The
              primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the
              16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report
              (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores
              indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary
              outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction
              in score of >50\%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score
              of $\leq$5) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were
              enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the
              escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline
              were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram
              group. The mean ($\pm$SE) changes in the scores from baseline to
              week 6 were -8.0$\pm$1.0 points in the psilocybin group and
              -6.0$\pm$1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group
              difference of 2.0 points (95\% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to
              0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70\% of the
              patients in the psilocybin group and in 48\% of those in the
              escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22
              percentage points (95\% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission
              occurred in 57\% and 28\%, respectively, for a between-group
              difference of 28 percentage points (95\% CI, 2 to 54). Other
              secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over
              escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple
              comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the
              trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in
              depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not
              show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between
              psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients.
              Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over
              escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked
              correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are
              required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants.

              regulation. We integrated research on social support, the
              self-regulation of emotion, and appraisal theories to hypothesize
              that different kinds of support and emotion regulation strategies
              should be differentially helpful for others, depending on the
              kind of emotion they are experiencing. Specifically, we predicted
              that helping others to actively modify their situation, as
              opposed to their appraisals and emotional responses, will be more
              effective for those experiencing anxiety as anxiety is a response

              statistical pattern recognition techniques to analyze human fMRI
              data. First, a machine learning algorithm was trained to
              discriminate patterns of fMRI responses based on relative
              egocentric distance within trials from one distance domain (e.g.,
              photographs of objects relatively close to or far away from the
              viewer in spatial distance trials). Next, we tested whether the
              decision boundary generated from this training could distinguish
              brain responses according to relative egocentric distance within
              each of two separate distance domains (e.g., phrases referring to

               Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network,
               and the relationship between people's happiness extends up to
               three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of
               one's friends' friends). People who are surrounded by many happy
               people and those who are central in the network are more likely
               to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models
               suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of
               happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with
               similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6
               km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a
               person is happy by 25\% (95\% confidence interval 1\% to 57\%).
               Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8\%, 0.2\% to

               about how status differences develop. In particular, little is
               known about the processes by which individuals pursue status in
               social groups. That is, how do individuals compete and jockey
               for status with their peers? The current paper reviews recent
               research that helps fill this gap in our knowledge.
               Specifically, studies of a variety of face-to-face groups show
               that individuals pursue status by enhancing the apparent value
               they provide to their group. Individuals compete for status not
               by bullying and intimidating others, as some theorists have
               proposed, but by behaving in ways that suggest high levels of
               competence, generosity, and commitment to the group.",

              includes the possibility for 'spontaneous' (or 'automatic')
              infection, in addition to disease transmission (the SISa model).
              Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we
              provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional
              states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social
              networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming
              content is increased by 0.02 per year for each content contact,
              and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04

               of one9s social partners. This dynamic structure permits an
               important form of conditional action that has been explored
               theoretically but has received little empirical attention:
               People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those
               around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we
               present experimental evidence of the power of using strategic
               link formation and dissolution, and the network modification it
               entails, to stabilize cooperation in sizable groups. Our
               experiments explore large-scale cooperation, where subjects'
               cooperative actions are equally beneficial to all those with
               whom they interact. Consistent with previous research, we find
               that cooperation decays over time when social networks are
               shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We
               also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only
               infrequently, cooperation again fails. However, when subjects
               can update their network connections frequently, we see a

               high level through network rewiring. Subjects preferentially

               images of one another's faces predict their future interpersonal

               associations between relationship-specific valuation activity
               and relationship-specific future liking. We found that one's own
               future (T2) liking of a particular group member is predicted
               jointly by actor's initial (T1) neural valuation of partner and
               by that partner's initial (T1) neural valuation of actor. These
               actor and partner effects exhibited equivalent predictive
               strength and were robust when statistically controlling for each
               other, both individuals' initial liking, and other potential
               drivers of liking. Behavioral findings indicated that liking was
               initially unreciprocated at T1 yet became strongly reciprocated

              Human participants viewed five images individually and
              sequentially with speeds up to 32 ms between items. Probabilistic

              that the hippocampal system is critical to normal learning and
              memory because of its function as the central part of a
              configural association system. This system constructs a unique
              representation of the joint occurrence of the independent
              elements of a compound. There is evidence consistent with the
              theory's predictions, however, there also are data that
              unambiguously demonstrate that, under some conditions, animals
              lacking an intact hippocampal system acquire configural
              associations. Thus, Sutherland and Rudy's fundamental assumption
              cannot be correct. To integrate the supporting and contradictory
              data, we propose two simple modifications of our position: 1) The
              critical neural system for configural associations is in cortical
              circuitry outside the hippocampus, and 2) the output from the
              hippocampal formation contributes to configural processing by
              selectively enhancing, thereby making more salient, cortical
              units representing stimulus conjunctions. This enhancement has
              two important effects: 1) It decreases the similarity between the
              configural units representing the co-occurrence of cues and the
              units representing the cues, and 2) It increases the rate at
              which the configural units can acquire associative strength. The
              modified theory explains why damage to the hippocampal formation
              only impairs learning on a subset of nonlinear discrimination
              problems. It also integrates recent data on the effects of
              hippocampal formation damage on conditioning involving context
              cues and makes novel predictions about performance on nonlinear

              To fully capture the complex social-cognitive system that give

               transcend one's current frames of reference. The psychological
               form and function of awe differ between two types: positive-awe,
               which arises from perceptually aesthetic experiences (e.g., the
               beauty of nature, spiritual experiences, or the virtue of a
               leader), and threat-awe, which is triggered by threatening
               stimuli (e.g., natural disasters, wrathful god, or a leader's
               coercive charisma). Here, using functional MRI, we investigated
               common and distinct neural responses to experiences of positive-
               and threat-awe, elicited by watching awe-inspiring videos. We
               found that both awe experiences deactivated the left middle
               temporal gyrus (MTG) in contrast to control conditions
               (positive-awe vs. amusement; threat-awe vs. fear), which suggest
               that awe experiences generally involve the ``schema liberation''
               process since the left MTG plays a critical role in matching
               existing schema to events. In addition, positive-awe was
               associated with increased functional connectivity between the
               MTG and the anterior/posterior cingulate cortex, which are
               associated with the aesthetic reward process, and the
               supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which is involved in the self-other
               representation. Threat-awe was associated with increased
               functional connectivity between the MTG and amygdala, which
               detects and processes threat stimuli, as well as between the
               amygdala and SMG. These findings suggest that the neural
               mechanisms underlying the complex psychological processes of awe
               vary as a function of the type of awe. The implications of these

              not differ. Consistent with competition between memory systems
              suggested by animal studies and neuroimaging, activity in these
              regions was negatively correlated across individuals. Further

              or in combination with other cues and subjects selected the
              outcome they thought was correct. Feedback was provided after
              each trial. In each task, the amnesic patients learned gradually
              to associate the cues with the appropriate outcome at the same
              rate as control subjects, improving from 50\% correct to
              approximately 65\% correct. Presumably because the cue-outcome
              associations were probabilistic, declarative memory for the
              outcomes of specific trials was not as useful for performance as
              the information gradually accrued across trials. Nevertheless,
              declarative memory does appear to make a contribution to
              performance when training is extended beyond approximately 50
              trials, because with further training control subjects eventually
              outperformed the amnesic patients. It was also demonstrated that

              result of holding knowledge of cue-outcome associations in
              short-term memory, because both control subjects and amnesic

              episodes may be connected because they share a similar location,
              time period, activity, spatial environment, or social and
              emotional content. However, we lack an understanding of how each
              of these dimensions contributes to the perceived similarity of
              two life memories. We addressed this question with a data-driven
              approach, eliciting pairs of real-life memories from
              participants. Participants annotated the social, purposive,
              spatial, temporal, and emotional characteristics of their
              memories. We found that the overall similarity of memories was
              influenced by all of these factors, but to very different
              extents. Emotional features were the most consistent single
              predictor of overall memory similarity. Memories with different
              emotional tone were reliably perceived to be dissimilar, even
              when they occurred at similar times and places and involved
              similar people; conversely, memories with a shared emotional tone
              were perceived as similar even when they occurred at different
              times and places, and involved different people. A predictive
              model explained over half of the variance in memory similarity,
              using only information about (i) the emotional properties of
              events and (ii) the primary action or purpose of events.
              Emotional features may make an outsized contribution to event
              similarity because they provide compact summaries of an event's
              goals and self-related outcomes, which are critical information
              for future planning and decision making. Thus, in order to
              understand and improve real-world memory function, we must
              account for the strong influence of emotional and purposive
              information on memory organization and memory search.
              Significance Our brains enable us to understand and act within
              the present, informed by previous, related life experience. But
              how are our life experiences organized so that one event can be
              related to another? Theories have suggested that we use
              spatiotemporal, social, causal, purposive, and emotional
              dimensions to inter-relate our memories; however, these
              organizing principles are usually studied using impersonal
              laboratory stimuli. Here, we mapped and modeled the connections
              between people's own annotated life memories. We found that life
              events are linked by a variety of factors, but are predominantly
              connected in memory by their primary activity and emotional
              character. This highlights a need for theories of memory

              participants were induced to generate criminal and noncriminal
              emotional false memories, and we compared these false memories
              with true memories of emotional events. After three interviews,
              70\% of participants were classified as having false memories of
              committing a crime (theft, assault, or assault with a weapon)
              that led to police contact in early adolescence and volunteered a
              detailed false account. These reported false memories of crime
              were similar to false memories of noncriminal events and to true
              memory accounts, having the same kinds of complex descriptive and
              multisensory components. It appears that in the context of a
              highly suggestive interview, people can quite readily generate
              rich false memories of committing crime.",

              roles during learning. Whereas the striatum and its network of
              thalamic relays and cortical nodes are necessary for
              nondeclarative learning, the MTL and associated network are
              required for declarative learning. Several studies have suggested
              that these networks are functionally competitive during learning.
              Since these discoveries, however, evidence has accumulated that
              they can operate in a cooperative fashion. In this review, we
              discuss evidence for both competition and cooperation between
              these systems during learning, with the aim of reconciling these
              seemingly contradictory findings. Examples of cooperation between
              the striatum and MTL have been provided, especially during
              consolidation and generalization of knowledge, and do not appear
              to be precluded by differences in functional specialization.
              However, whether these systems cooperate or compete does seem to
              depend on the phase of learning and cognitive or motor aspects of
              the task. The involvement of other regions, such as midbrain

              mediate cooperation between the striatum and the MTL during

              encoding of single events (episodic memory). Although
              traditionally studied separately, in even simple experiences,
              these two types of learning are likely to co-occur and may
              interact. Here we sought to understand the nature of this
              interaction by examining how incremental reward learning is
              related to concurrent episodic memory encoding. During the
              experiment, human participants made choices between two options
              (colored squares), each associated with a drifting probability of
              reward, with the goal of earning as much money as possible.
              Incidental, trial-unique object pictures, unrelated to the
              choice, were overlaid on each option. The next day, participants
              were given a surprise memory test for these pictures. We found

              the retrieval of general conceptual knowledge divested of a
              specific spatiotemporal context. The neural substrates of the
              episodic and semantic memory systems have been dissociated in
              healthy individuals during functional imaging studies, and in
              clinical cohorts, leading to the prevailing view that episodic
              and semantic memory represent functionally distinct systems
              subtended by discrete neurobiological substrates. Importantly,
              however, converging evidence focusing on widespread neural
              networks now points to significant overlap between those regions
              essential for retrieval of autobiographical memories, episodic

              memory is viewed as an adaptive and constructive process which
              facilitates the imagining of possible events in the future. We

              possibility of different scenarios involving either real or
              fictional characters being true, given the reality of our world.
              The processing of real and fictional scenarios activated a common
              set of regions including medial-temporal lobe structures. When
              the scenarios involved real people, brain regions associated with
              episodic memory retrieval and self-referential thinking, the

              literature on multiple-component memory processing, we
              hypothesize that prior-knowledge triggers additional evaluative,
              semantic, or episodic-binding processes, mainly supported by the
              ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior temporal pole

              To test this hypothesis, we scanned 20 human participants with
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they
              associated novel houses with famous or nonfamous faces.
              Behaviorally, we found beneficial effects of prior-knowledge on
              associative memory. At the brain level, we found that the vmPFC
              and HPC, as well as the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and

              Connectivity analyses also suggested that HPC connectivity with
              the vmPFC plays a more important role in the famous than

               considerable consensus on the structure of the self, which
               emphasizes multiple self representations, with each individual

               another person or role) as well as to typical scripts and goals.
               Yet there is less consensus on the content of these self-schema
               structures, and research has not systematically investigated
               content when self-schemas are assessed in a content-valid
               manner. In the present study, participants identified their six
               most accessible self-with-other and/or self-in-role contexts and
               were also assigned a ?self-as-student? context. For each
               individual self-schema, participants wrote descriptions of
               associated scripts and goals and listed self-descriptive
               adjectives. This self-schema content revealed relatedness,
               competence, and autonomy psychological need themes which were

              the intersection between social cognition and reinforcement
              learning. Perceivers were scanned using fMRI while repeatedly
              encountering three social targets who produced conflicting visual
              and verbal emotional cues. Perceivers guessed how targets felt
              and received feedback about whether they had guessed correctly.
              Visual cues reliably predicted one target's emotion, verbal cues
              predicted a second target's emotion, and neither reliably
              predicted the third target's emotion. Perceivers successfully

              of value-based decision-making. However, less is known about the
              role of the hippocampus in value-based learning. Such learning is
              typically associated with a striatal system, yet a small number
              of studies, both in human and nonhuman species, suggest
              hippocampal engagement. It is not clear, however, whether this
              engagement is necessary for such learning. In the present study,
              we used both functional MRI (fMRI) and lesion-based
              neuropsychological methods to clarify hippocampal contributions
              to value-based learning. In Experiment 1, healthy participants
              were scanned while learning value-based contingencies (whether
              players in a ``game'' win money) in the context of a
              probabilistic learning task. Here, we observed recruitment of the
              hippocampus, in addition to the expected ventral striatal
              (nucleus accumbens) activation that typically accompanies such
              learning. In Experiment 2, we administered this task to amnesic
              patients with medial temporal lobe damage and to healthy
              controls. Amnesic patients, including those with damage
              circumscribed to the hippocampus, failed to acquire value-based
              contingencies, thus confirming that hippocampal engagement is
              necessary for task performance. Control experiments established

              which the hippocampus contributes to value-based learning, but

              Subjects (N = 25) completed a configural threat learning task,

              negative emotional event are represented in memory can have
              important implications for extinction strategies designed to

              multi-day threat conditioning and extinction task to assess
              whether participants generalize extinction from one cue to
              unextinguished cues. On Day 1, one group of participants learned
              that a compound conditioned stimulus, composed of a tone and
              colored square, predicted an uncomfortable shock to the wrist
              (Compound group). A second group learned that the tone and square
              separately predicted shock (Separate group). On Day 2,
              participants in both groups were exposed to the tone in the
              absence of shocks (cue extinction). On Day 3, we tested whether
              extinction generalized from the extinguished to the
              unextinguished cue, as well as to a compound composed of both
              cues. Results showed that configural and elemental learning had
              unique and opposite effects on extinction generalization.
              Subjects who initially learned that a compound cue predicted
              shock successfully generalized extinction learning from the tone
              to the square, but exhibited threat relapse to the compound cue.
              In contrast, subjects who initially learned that each cue
              individually predicted shock did not generalize extinction
              learning from the tone to the square, but threat responses to the
              compound were low. These results highlight the importance of
              whether details of an aversive event are represented as

              Recent studies have begun to link study of the influence of
              emotional arousal on memory with earlier research indicating that
              memory is organized in multiple systems in the brain that differ
              in terms of the ``type'' of memory they mediate. Specifically,
              these studies have examined whether emotional arousal may have a
              differential effect on the ``cognitive'' and stimulus-response
              ``habit'' memory processes sub-served by the hippocampus and
              dorsal striatum, respectively. Evidence indicates that stress or
              the peripheral injection of anxiogenic drugs can bias animals and
              humans toward the use of striatal-dependent habit memory in
              dual-solution tasks in which both hippocampal and striatal-based
              strategies can provide an adequate solution. A bias toward the
              use of habit memory can also be produced by intra-basolateral
              amygdala (BLA) administration of anxiogenic drugs, consistent
              with the well documented role of efferent projections of this
              brain region in mediating the modulatory influence of emotional
              arousal on memory. In some learning situations, the bias toward
              the use of habit memory produced by emotional arousal appears to
              result from an impairing effect on hippocampus-dependent
              cognitive memory. Further research examining the neural

               study of the human mind. Based on his classroom lessons and
               first published in 1890, James has gathered together what he
               feels to be the most interesting and most accessible information
               for the beginning student. Psychology, according to James, deals
               with thoughts and feelings as its facts and does not attempt to
               determine where such things come from. This would be the realm
               of metaphysics, and he is careful to avoid crossing over from
               science into philosophy. This second volume covers sensation,
               imagination, reasoning, instinct, emotions, will, movement, and
               the perception of objects and space. Anyone wanting a thorough
               introduction to psychology will find this work useful and

              The SRT task was performed under two conditions. With attentional
              interference from a secondary counting task there was no
              development of awareness of the sequence. Learning-related
              increases of cerebral blood flow were located in contralateral
              motor effector areas including motor cortex, supplementary motor
              area, and putamen, consistent with the hypothesis that
              nondeclarative motor learning occurs in cerebral areas that
              control limb movements. Additional cortical sites included the
              rostral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex. The SRT learning

              interaction. Here, we show that the task-independent presentation

               govern the emotion of fear. In this view, the amygdala is
               necessary for a person to feel afraid, and when amygdala

               afraid or threatened. In this paper, we review current research
               on amygdala function that calls into question this

              memory encoding and consolidation of new experiences so we cannot
              only remember the past, but also guide behavior in the present
              and predict the future. However, very strong schemas can also
              lead to unwanted side effects such as false memories and
              misconceptions. To overcome this overreliance on a schema, we
              should aim to create robust schemas that are on the one hand
              strong enough to help to remember and predict, but also malleable
              enough to avoid such undesirable side effects. This raises the
              question as to whether there are ways to deliberately influence
              knowledge construction processes, with the goal to reach such
              optimally balanced schemas. Here, we will discuss how the

  abstract = "Cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular
              method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in
              neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and
              diffuse signals. However, cluster-extent based thresholding
              provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that
              there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot
              make inferences about the statistical significance of specific
              locations within the cluster. This poses a particular problem
              when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e.,
              higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning
              multiple anatomical regions. In such cases, it is impossible to
              reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. From a
              survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of
              liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p<.01) is endemic, and that the
              largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default
              option in the software used. We illustrate the problems with
              liberal primary thresholds using an fMRI dataset from our

              lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or

              activity has gained popularity in the neuroimaging community in

              focusing on whether information relating to specific stimuli is
              encoded in patterns of activity across multiple voxels. If a
              stimulus can be predicted, or decoded, solely from the pattern of

              stimulus represented in the brain region where the pattern across
              voxels was identified. This ability to examine the representation
              of information relating to specific stimuli (e.g., memories) in

               straightforward to calculate for blocked trials or slow

               evoked BOLD signal for adjacent trials will overlap in time,
               complicating the identification of signal unique to specific
               trials. Rapid event-related designs are often preferred because
               they allow for more stimuli to be presented and subjects tend to
               be more focused on the task, and thus it would be beneficial to
               be able to use these types of designs in MVPA analyses. The

              Bayesian statistics with propositional logic provides a new
              approach for data analyses in fMRI. Two different methods are
              introduced for propositional logic: the first for analyses using
              the GLM and the second for common inferences about different
              probability maps. CONCLUSION: The methods introduced extend the
              idea of conjunction analysis to a full propositional logic and
              adapt it from test-statistics to Bayesian statistics. The new
              approaches allow inferences that are not possible with known
              standard methods in fMRI.",

              probability maps that enable conditional or Bayesian inferences
              about regionally specific effects in neuroimaging. Posterior
              probability maps are images of the probability or confidence that
              an activation exceeds some specified threshold, given the data.
              Posterior probability maps (PPMs) represent a complementary
              alternative to statistical parametric maps (SPMs) that are used
              to make classical inferences. However, a key problem in Bayesian
              inference is the specification of appropriate priors. This
              problem can be finessed using empirical Bayes in which prior
              variances are estimated from the data, under some simple
              assumptions about their form. Empirical Bayes requires a
              hierarchical observation model, in which higher levels can be
              regarded as providing prior constraints on lower levels. In
              neuroimaging, observations of the same effect over voxels provide
              a natural, two-level hierarchy that enables an empirical Bayesian
              approach. In this note we present a brief motivation and the
              operational details of a simple empirical Bayesian method for
              computing posterior probability maps. We then compare Bayesian

              ability to detect and integrate novel information. In this
              review, we discuss recent evidence suggesting that the neural
              substrates sensitive to detecting familiarity and novelty are not
              entirely overlapping. Instead, these partially distinct
              familiarity and novelty signals are integrated to support
              recognition memory decisions. We propose here that the
              mediodorsal thalamus is critical for familiarity detection, and
              for combining novelty signals from the medial temporal lobe
              cortex with the relative familiarity outputs of computations
              performed in other cortical structures, especially the prefrontal
              cortex. Importantly, we argue that the anterior hippocampus has a
              prominent role in detecting novelty and in communicating this
              with midbrain and striatal structures. We argue that different
              types of novelty (absolute or contextual) engage different
              neurotransmitter systems that converge in the hippocampus. We
              suggest that contextual or unexpected novelty triggers
              dopaminergic hippocampal-midbrain coupling and
              noradrenergic-mediated pupil dilation. In contrast, absolute
              novelty triggers cholinergic-mediated hippocampal encoding
              accompanied by diminished pupil dilation. These two, distinct
              hippocampal encoding mechanisms both lead to later recollection

              between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity
              measures have been much studied using network theory in order to
              uncover the distributed organization of brain structures, in

              ``static'' despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained
              from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by
              introducing a network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain
              effective connectivity (EC) useful to interpret the brain
              dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
              (MOU) process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain
              resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for MOU-EC
              as well as input properties (similar to local excitabilities).
              The network analysis is then based on the Green function (or
              network impulse response) that describes the interactions between
              nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This model-based
              approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptor, named

              connections play in the propagation of activity within the

              also enables the comparison of estimates from real data with
              surrogates (e.g. random network or ring lattice). In contrast to
              classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework

              communities over time, moving from segregated to global

              memory formation that takes place in the context of activated

              integrates new information into existing knowledge structures.

              investigated memory formation in the context of prior knowledge

              knowledge-congruency (the perceived match between prior knowledge

              used to explore the associations between brain areas. Structural
              connectivity (SC) captures the anatomical pathways across the
              brain and functional connectivity (FC) measures the correlation
              between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity
              measures have been much studied using network theory in order to
              uncover the distributed organization of brain structures, in
              particular FC for task-specific brain communication. However, the
              application of network theory to study FC matrices is often
              ``static'' despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained
              from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by
              introducing a network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain
              effective connectivity (EC) useful to interpret the brain
              dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
              (MOU) process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain
              resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for MOU-EC
              as well as input properties (similar to local excitabilities).
              The network analysis is then based on the Green function (or
              network impulse response) that describes the interactions between
              nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This model-based
              approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptor, named
              communicability, that characterize the roles that either nodes or
              connections play in the propagation of activity within the
              network. They can be used at both global and local levels, and
              also enables the comparison of estimates from real data with
              surrogates (e.g. random network or ring lattice). In contrast to
              classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework
              stresses the importance of taking the temporal aspect of fMRI
              signals into account. Our results show a merging of functional
              communities over time (in which input properties play a role),
              moving from segregated to global integration of the network
              activity. Our formalism sets a solid ground for the analysis and

              Working memory plays a key role in tracking and segmenting a

              working memory is related to individual variability in event

               competition between incompatible responses. In prior work, we
               provided initial support for this hypothesis, demonstrating ACC
               activity in the same region both during error trials and during
               correct trials in task conditions designed to elicit greater
               response competition. In the present study, we extend our
               testing of this hypothesis to task situations involving
               underdetermined responding. Specifically, 14 healthy control
               subjects performed a verb-generation task during event-related
               functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with the on-line
               acquisition of overt verbal responses. The results demonstrated
               that the ACC, and only the ACC, was more active in a series of
               task conditions that elicited competition among alternative
               responses. These conditions included a greater ACC response to:
               (1) Nouns categorized as low vs. high constraint (i.e., during a
               norming study, multiple verbs were produced with equal frequency
               vs. a single verb that produced much more frequently than any
               other); (2) the production of verbs that were weak associates,
               rather than, strong associates of particular nouns; and (3) the
               production of verbs that were weak associates for nouns
               categorized as high constraint. We discuss the implication of
               these results for understanding the role that the ACC plays in
               human cognition.",

              PCC plays in memory encoding is lacking. In human female and male
              participants (N = 17) undergoing seizure mapping, we investigated
              functional properties of the PCC using deep brain stimulation

              was applied during presentation of the remaining lists. We
              investigated whether stimulation affected memory and modulated
              hippocampal activity. Results revealed four main findings. First,
              stimulation during episodic memory encoding impaired subsequent
              free recall, predominantly for items presented early in the study

              are critical public health challenges. Deep brain stimulation
              (DBS) is a promising tool for developing strategies to ameliorate
              memory disorders by targeting brain regions involved in mnemonic
              processing. Using DBS, our study sheds light on the lesser-known
              role of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in memory encoding.
              Stimulating the PCC during encoding impairs subsequent recall
              memory. The degree of impairment is predicted by
              stimulation-induced hippocampal gamma oscillations and functional
              connectivity between PCC and hippocampus. Our findings provide
              the first causal evidence implicating PCC in memory encoding and
              highlight the PCC as a favorable target for neuromodulation
              strategies using a priori connectivity measures to predict
              stimulation effects. This has significant implications for

               memory and age-related memory deficits. The PMC shows
               deactivations during a variety of demanding cognitive tasks as
               compared to passive baseline conditions and has been associated
               with the default-mode of the brain. Interestingly, the PMC
               exhibits opposite levels of functional MRI activity during
               encoding (learning) and retrieval (remembering), a pattern
               dubbed the encoding/retrieval flip (E/R-flip). Yet, the exact
               role of the PMC in memory function has remained unclear. This
               review discusses the possible neurofunctional and clinical
               significance of the E/R-flip pattern. Regarding neurofunctional
               relevance, we will review four hypotheses on PMC function: (1)
               the internal orienting account, (2) the self-referential
               processing account, (3) the reallocation account, and (4) the
               bottom-up attention account. None of these accounts seem to
               provide a complete explanation for the E/R-flip pattern in PMC.
               Regarding clinical relevance, we review work on aging and
               Alzheimer's disease, indicating that amyloid deposits within
               PMC, years before clinical memory deficits become apparent. High
               amyloid burden within PMC is associated with detrimental
               influences on memory encoding, in particular, the attenuation of
               beneficial PMC deactivations. Finally, we discuss functional
               subdivisions within PMC that help to provide a more precise
               picture of the variety of signals observed within PMC.
               Collective data from anatomical, task-related fMRI and
               resting-state studies all indicate that the PMC is composed of
               three main regions, the precuneus, retrosplenial, and posterior
               cingulate cortex, each with a distinct function. We will

  abstract = "Many neurons in extrastriate visual cortex have large receptive
              fields, and this may lead to significant computational problems
              whenever multiple stimuli fall within a single field. Previous
              studies have suggested that when multiple stimuli fall within a
              cell's receptive field, they compete for the cell's response in a
              manner that can be biased in favor of attended stimuli. In the
              present study we examined this role of attention in areas V1, V2,
              and V4 of macaque monkeys with the use of a behavioral paradigm
              in which attention was directed to one of two stimulus locations.
              When two stimuli were presented simultaneously inside the cell's
              receptive field (which could be accomplished only in areas V2 and
              V4), we found that the cell's response was strongly influenced by
              which of the two stimuli was attended. The size of this attention
              effect was reduced when the attended and ignored stimuli were
              presented sequentially rather than simultaneously. In addition,
              the effects became very weak and inconsistent in these areas when
              only one of the two stimuli was located inside the receptive
              field. Attention thus modulated sensory responses primarily when
              two or more simultaneous stimuli competed for access to a
              neuron's receptive field. As in areas V2 and V4, attention did
              not modulate sensory responses in area V1 when only a single
              stimulus was inside the receptive field. In addition, the small
              receptive fields in this area precluded the simultaneous
              presentation of attended and ignored stimuli inside the receptive
              field, making it impossible to determine whether attention
              effects would be observed under the conditions that led to
              consistent attention effects in areas V2 and V4. Spontaneous
              firing rates in areas V2 and V4 were found to be 30-40\% higher
              when attention was directed inside rather than outside the
              receptive field, even when no stimulus was present in the
              receptive field. Spontaneous firing rates also varied according
              to the particular location within the receptive field that was
              attended. These shifts in spontaneous activity may reflect a
              top-down signal that biases responses in favor of stimuli at the

              events. During fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging),
              individuals watched a 90 s movie clip six times. Using a hidden
              Markov model applied to searchlights across the whole brain, we
              identified temporal shifts between activity patterns evoked by
              the first vs. repeated viewings of the movie clip. In many
              regions throughout the cortex, neural activity patterns for
              repeated viewings shifted to precede those of initial viewing by
              up to 15 s. This anticipation varied hierarchically in a
              posterior (less anticipation) to anterior (more anticipation)

              Histologic studies of retrosplenial areas 29 and 30 identify them
              on the ventral bank of the cingulate gyrus (CGv), whereas
              standardized atlases show area 30 on the surface of the
              caudomedial region. This study evaluates all areas on the CGv and
              caudomedial region with rigorous cytologic criteria in coronal
              and oblique sections Nissl stained or immunoreacted for
              neuron-specific nuclear binding protein and nonphosphorylated
              neurofilament proteins (NFP-ir). Ectosplenial area 26 has a
              granular layer with few large pyramidal neurons below. Lateral
              area 29 (29l) has a dense granular layer II-IV and
              undifferentiated layers V and VI. Medial area 29 (29m) has a
              layer III of medium and NFP-ir pyramids and a layer IV with some
              large, NFP-ir pyramidal neurons that distinguish it from areas
              29l, 30, and 27. Although area 29m is primarily on the CGv, a
              terminal branch can extend onto the caudomedial lobule. Area 30
              is dysgranular with a variable thickness layer IV that is
              interrupted by large NFP-ir neurons in layers IIIc and Va.
              Although area 30 does not appear on the surface of the
              caudomedial lobule, a terminal branch can form less that 1\% of
              this gyrus. Area 23a is isocortex with a clear layer IV and
              large, NFP-ir neurons in layers IIIc and Va. Area 23b is similar
              to area 23a but with a thicker layer IV, more large neurons in
              layer Va, and a higher density of NFP-ir neurons in layer III.
              The caudomedial gyral surface is composed of areas 23a and 23b
              and a caudal extension of area 31. Although posterior area 27 and
              the parasubiculum are similar to rostral levels, posterior area
              36' differs from rostral area 36. Subregional flat maps show that
              retrosplenial cortex is on the CGv, most of the surface of
              caudomedial cortex is areas 23a, 23b, and 31, and the
              retrosplenial/parahippocampal border is at the ventral edge of
              the splenium. Thus, Brodmann's map understates the rostral extent
              of retrosplenial cortex, overstates its caudoventral extent, and
              abridges the caudomedial extent of area 23.",

               the superior parietal cortex, paracentral lobule, and motor
               cortex, suggesting a sensorimotor region; (ii) the central
               precuneus, functionally connected to the dorsolateral

              (approximately 78\% of the total labeled cells). In the remainder
              of the cortex, the heaviest projections originated in the
              hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex,
              subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The parahippocampal
              and perirhinal cortices also contained many labeled neurons, as
              did the prefrontal cortex, mainly in areas 46, 9, 10, and 11, and
              the occipital cortex, mainly area V2. Injections in area 23 also
              resulted in numerous labeled cells in the posterior cingulate and
              retrosplenial regions (approximately 67\% of total labeled
              cells). As in the retrosplenial cortex, injections of area 23 led
              to many labeled neurons in the frontal cortex, although most of
              these cells were in areas 9 and 46. Larger numbers of

              the posterior parietal cortex, including areas 7a, 7m, LIP, and

              the prefrontal areas and the long-term memory encoding in the
              medial temporal lobe. The posterior cingulate cortex, in

              version of the FADE score, termed FADE-SAME (Similarity of
              Activations during Memory Encoding), which differs from the
              original FADE score by considering not only activations but also
              deactivations in fMRI contrasts of stimulus novelty and
              successful encoding, and by taking into account the variance of
              young adults' activations. We computed both scores for novelty
              and subsequent memory contrasts in a cohort of 217 healthy
              adults, including 106 young and 111 older participants, as well
              as a replication cohort of 117 young subjects. We further tested

              different data sets of young adults as reference samples. Both

              exhibited age-group-related differences for the novelty contrast.
              Furthermore, both scores correlate with behavioral measures of
              cognitive aging, namely memory performance. Taken together, our
              results suggest that single-value scores of memory-related fMRI

  abstract = "Predictive models for neural or fMRI data are often fit using
              regression methods that employ priors on the model parameters.
              One widely used method is ridge regression, which employs a
              spherical multivariate normal prior that assumes equal and
              independent variance for all parameters. However, a spherical
              prior is not always optimal or appropriate. There are many cases
              where expert knowledge or hypotheses about the structure of the
              model parameters could be used to construct a better prior. In
              these cases, non-spherical multivariate normal priors can be
              employed using a generalized form of ridge known as Tikhonov
              regression. Yet Tikhonov regression is only rarely used in
              neuroscience. In this paper we discuss the theoretical basis for
              Tikhonov regression, demonstrate a computationally efficient
              method for its application, and show several examples of how
              Tikhonov regression can improve predictive models for fMRI data.
              We also show that many earlier studies have implicitly used
              Tikhonov regression by linearly transforming the regressors
              before performing ridge regression.",

  abstract = "Encoding and decoding models are widely used in systems,
              cognitive, and computational neuroscience to make sense of
              brain-activity data. However, the interpretation of their results
              requires care. Decoding models can help reveal whether particular
              information is present in a brain region in a format the decoder
              can exploit. Encoding models make comprehensive predictions about
              representational spaces. In the context of sensory experiments,
              where stimuli are experimentally controlled, encoding models
              enable us to test and compare brain-computational theories.
              Encoding and decoding models typically include fitted
              linear-model components. Sometimes the weights of the fitted
              linear combinations are interpreted as reflecting, in an encoding
              model, the contribution of different sensory features to the
              representation or, in a decoding model, the contribution of
              different measured brain responses to a decoded feature. Such
              interpretations can be problematic when the predictor variables
              or their noise components are correlated and when priors (or
              penalties) are used to regularize the fit. Encoding and decoding
              models are evaluated in terms of their generalization
              performance. The correct interpretation depends on the level of
              generalization a model achieves (e.g. to new response
              measurements for the same stimuli, to new stimuli from the same
              population, or to stimuli from a different population).
              Significant decoding or encoding performance of a single model
              (at whatever level of generality) does not provide strong
              constraints for theory. Many models must be tested and

  abstract = "Over the past decade fMRI researchers have developed increasingly
              sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in
              BOLD activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear
              classification, a simple technique for decoding information about
              experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an
              array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based
              encoding model, which describes the information about the
              stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single
              voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations:
              encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses
              activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in
              practice these two operations are often confused, and their
              respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear.
              Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify
              the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that
              encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate
              some of the most common questions about how information is
              represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models
              offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding
              model can in principle provide a complete functional description
              of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only
              a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to
              derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is
              much more difficult to derive an encoding model from a decoding
              model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by
              estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends
              by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.",

              challenging when i) the factors under investigation are difficult
              to manipulate independently from one-another and ii) observations
              are high-dimensional. To address this issue, we introduce
              ''Back-to-Back'' regression (B2B), a linear method designed to
              efficiently estimate, from a set of correlated factors, those
              that most plausibly account for multidimensional observations.
              First, we prove the consistency of B2B, its links to other linear
              approaches, and show how it can provide a robust, unbiased and
              interpretable scalar estimate for each factor. Second, we use a
              variety of simulated data to show that B2B can outperform forward
              modeling (``encoding''), backward modeling (``decoding'') as well
              as cross-decomposition modeling (i.e. canonical correlation
              analysis and partial least squares) on causal identification when
              the factors and the observations are not orthogonal. Finally, we
              apply B2B to a hundred magneto-encephalography recordings and to
              a hundred functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging recordings
              acquired while subjects performed a 1 ​h reading task. B2B
              successfully disentangles the respective contribution of
              collinear factors such as word length, word frequency in the
              early visual and late associative cortical responses
              respectively. B2B compared favorably to other standard techniques
              on this disentanglement. We discuss how the speed and the
              generality of B2B sets promising foundations to help identify the

              novelty prepares, or primes, brain circuitry to facilitate
              cognitive flexibility has important translational relevance.
              Exposure to novelty recruits the hippocampus and medial
              prefrontal cortex (mPFC)2 and may prime hippocampal-prefrontal
              circuitry for subsequent learning-associated plasticity. Here we
              show that novelty resets the neural circuits that link the
              ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and the mPFC, facilitating the ability
              to overcome an established strategy. Exposing mice to novelty
              disrupted a previously encoded strategy by reorganizing vHPC
              activity to local theta (4-12 Hz) oscillations and weakening
              existing vHPC-mPFC connectivity. As mice subsequently adapted to
              a new task, vHPC neurons developed new task-associated activity,
              vHPC-mPFC connectivity was strengthened, and mPFC neurons updated
              to encode the new rules. Without novelty, however, mice adhered
              to their established strategy. Blocking dopamine D1 receptors

              Object-recognition memory (ORM) serves to judge the familiarity

              yet had a chance to consolidate are vulnerable to the interfering
              force of mental activity and memory formation (even if the
              interfering activity is not similar to the previously learned
              material). This account helps to explain why sleep, alcohol, and
              benzodiazepines all improve memory for a recently learned list,
              and it is consistent with recent work on the variables that
              affect the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation in
              the hippocampus.",

              readiness to detect and retrieve old stimuli but also in its
              ability to detect and integrate novel information. In this
              review, we discuss recent evidence suggesting that the neural
              substrates sensitive to detecting familiarity and novelty are not
              entirely overlapping. Instead, these partially distinct
              familiarity and novelty signals are integrated to support
              recognition memory decisions. We propose here that the
              mediodorsal thalamus is critical for familiarity detection, and
              for combining novelty signals from the medial temporal lobe
              cortex with the relative familiarity outputs of computations
              performed in other cortical structures, especially the prefrontal
              cortex. Importantly, we argue that the anterior hippocampus has a
              prominent role in detecting novelty and in communicating this
              with midbrain and striatal structures. We argue that different
              types of novelty (absolute or contextual) engage different
              neurotransmitter systems that converge in the hippocampus. We
              suggest that contextual or unexpected novelty triggers
              dopaminergic hippocampal-midbrain coupling and
              noradrenergic-mediated pupil dilation. In contrast, absolute
              novelty triggers cholinergic-mediated hippocampal encoding
              accompanied by diminished pupil dilation. These two, distinct
              hippocampal encoding mechanisms both lead to later recollection
              but are sensitive to different types of novelty. We conclude that
              this neurotransmitter-mediated hippocampal encoding establishes

              a virtual environment to characterize episodic memory profiles in
              an ecological fashion, which includes memory for central and
              perceptual details, spatiotemporal contextual elements, and
              binding. This study included subjects from three different
              populations: healthy older adults, patients with amnestic mild
              cognitive impairment (aMCI) and patients with early to moderate
              Alzheimer's disease (AD). Second, we sought to determine whether
              environmental factors that can affect encoding (active vs.
              passive exploration) influence memory performance in pathological
              aging. Third, we benchmarked the results of our virtual reality
              episodic memory test against a classical memory test and a
              subjective daily memory complaint scale. Here, the participants
              were successively immersed in two virtual environments; the
              first, as the driver of a virtual car (active exploration) and
              the second, as the passenger of that car (passive exploration).
              Subjects were instructed to encode all elements of the
              environment as well as the associated spatiotemporal contexts.
              Following each immersion, we assessed the patient's recall and
              recognition of central information (i.e., the elements of the
              environment), contextual information (i.e., temporal, egocentric
              and allocentric spatial information) and lastly, the quality of
              binding. We found that the AD patients' performances were
              inferior to that of the aMCI and even more to that of the healthy
              aged groups, in line with the progression of hippocampal atrophy
              reported in the literature. Spatial allocentric memory
              assessments were found to be particularly useful for
              distinguishing aMCI patients from healthy older adults. Active
              exploration yielded enhanced recall of central and allocentric
              spatial information, as well as binding in all groups. This led
              aMCI patients to achieve better performance scores on immediate
              temporal memory tasks. Finally, the patients' daily memory
              complaints were more highly correlated with the performances on
              the virtual test than with their performances on the classical
              memory test. Taken together, these results highlight specific
              cognitive differences found between these three populations that
              may provide additional insight into the early diagnosis and
              rehabilitation of pathological aging. In particular,
              neuropsychological studies would benefit to use virtual tests and
              a multi-component approach to assess episodic memory, and
              encourage active encoding of information in patients suffering
              from mild or severe age-related memory impairment. The beneficial
              effect of active encoding on episodic memory in aMCI and early to

              at high load there was a significant context effect in the FC of
              the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and greater FC
              in the second movie was related to greater proactive
              interference. Further, older adults showed context effect in the
              PCC and vlPFC. Intriguingly, older adults with inter-SC mPFC
              patterns similar to younger adults exhibited schema benefit in
              our task, while those with inter-SC PCC patterns similar to
              younger adults showed proactive interference in an independent
              task. The brain-behavior relationships corroborate the functional
              significance of these regions and indicate that the mPFC mainly
              contributes to schema benefit, while the left vlPFC and PCC
              contribute to proactive interference. Importantly, our findings

               contexts prompt action automatically, through activation of
               mental context--action associations learned through prior
               performances. Habitual behavior is regulated by an impulsive
               process, and so can be elicited with minimal cognitive effort,
               awareness, control, or intention. When an initially
               goal-directed behavior becomes habitual, action initiation
               transfers from conscious motivational processes to context-cued
               impulse-driven mechanisms. Regulation of action becomes detached
               from motivational or volitional control. Upon encountering the
               associated context, the urge to enact the habitual behavior is
               spontaneously triggered and alternative behavioral responses
               become less cognitively accessible.By virtue of its
               cue-dependent automatic nature, theory proposes that habit
               strength will predict the likelihood of enactment of habitual
               behavior, and that strong habitual tendencies will tend to
               dominate over motivational tendencies. Support for these effects
               has been found for many health-related behaviors, such as
               healthy eating, physical activity, and medication adherence.
               This has stimulated interest in habit formation as a behavior
               change mechanism: It has been argued that adding habit formation
               components into behavior change interventions should shield new
               behaviors against motivational lapses, making them more
               sustainable in the long-term. Interventions based on the
               habit-formation model differ from non-habit-based interventions
               in that they include elements that promote reliable
               context-dependent repetition of the target behavior, with the
               aim of establishing learned context--action associations that
               manifest in automatically cued behavioral responses.
               Interventions may also seek to harness these processes to
               displace an existing ``bad'' habit with a ``good''
               habit.Research around the application of habit formation to
               health behavior change interventions is reviewed, drawn from two
               sources: extant theory and evidence regarding how habit forms,
               and previous interventions that have used habit formation
               principles and techniques to change behavior. Behavior change
               techniques that may facilitate movement through discrete phases
               in the habit formation trajectory are highlighted, and
               techniques that have been used in previous interventions are
               explored based on a habit formation framework. Although these
               interventions have mostly shown promising effects on behavior,
               the unique impact on behavior of habit-focused components and
               the longevity of such effects are not yet known. As an
               intervention strategy, habit formation has been shown to be
               acceptable to intervention recipients, who report that through
               repetition, behaviors gradually become routinized. Whether habit
               formation interventions truly offer a route to long-lasting
               behavior change, however, remains unclear.",

              ability to inhibit such processes when those predictions fail.
              Mounting evidence suggests that relative to younger adults, older
              adults have difficulty retrieving episodic memories and
              inhibiting prior knowledge, even when that knowledge is
              detrimental to the task at hand. However, the consequences of

              whether overreliance on prior knowledge alters the gaze patterns
              and performance of older adults during visual search. Younger and
              older adults searched for target objects in congruent or

              in congruent locations were detected faster than targets in
              incongruent locations, and this effect was enhanced in older
              adults. Analysis of viewing behavior revealed that prior
              knowledge effects emerged early in search, as evidenced by
              initial saccades, and continued throughout search, with greater
              viewing of congruent regions by older relative to younger adults,
              suggesting that schema biasing of online processing increases

              inflexibility and emotional dysregulation domains are still a
              matter of discussion. AIMS: The present study aims to explore the

              psychological inflexibility), emotion regulation strategies, such
              as cognitive reappraisal and emotional suppression and emotional
              dysregulation domains in two different samples. METHOD: In a
              cross-sectional design, 297 individuals were assessed with
              self-report measures and divided into non-clinical (n = 231) and
              clinical samples (n = 66), according to diagnosis. RESULTS:
              Results showed that the degree of cognitive fusion was higher in
              the clinical sample. However, significant correlations between
              cognitive fusion, emotional regulation strategies and emotional
              dysregulation domains were found in the two samples. Cognitive
              reappraisal and emotional dysregulation domains predicted
              cognitive fusion and mediated the relationship between cognitive
              fusion and symptomatology in the two samples. CONCLUSIONS:
              Relationships between cognitive fusion and emotional
              dysregulation domains were found independent of diagnosis. The
              implementation of emotion regulation strategies may be related to

              prediction error expressed in the striatum is modulated by the
              administration of drugs enhancing (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine;
              L-DOPA) or reducing (haloperidol) dopaminergic function.
              Accordingly, subjects treated with L-DOPA have a greater
              propensity to choose the most rewarding action relative to
              subjects treated with haloperidol. Furthermore, incorporating the
              magnitude of the prediction errors into a standard action-value
              learning algorithm accurately reproduced subjects' behavioural
              choices under the different drug conditions. We conclude that
              dopamine-dependent modulation of striatal activity can account
              for how the human brain uses reward prediction errors to improve
              future decisions.",

              nature and temporal evolution of the biological changes that
              accompany encoding, storage, and retrieval is key to understand
              memory formation. For explicit or medial temporal lobe-dependent
              memories that form after a discrete event and are stored for a
              long time, the physical changes underlying the encoding and
              processing of the information (memory trace or engram) remain in
              a fragile state for some time. However, over time, the new memory
              becomes increasingly resistant to disruption until it is
              consolidated. Retrieval or reactivation of an apparently
              consolidated memory can render the memory labile again, and
              reconsolidation is the process that occurs to mediate its
              restabilization. Reconsolidation also evolves with the age of the
              memory: Young memories are sensitive to post-reactivation
              disruption, but older memories are more resistant. Why does a
              memory become labile again if it is retrieved or reactivated?
              Here I suggest that the main function of reconsolidation is to
              contribute to the lingering consolidation process and mediate
              memory strengthening. I also discuss the literature and results

              particular theoretical origin, whose main source is William
              James. Thus, habits have been characterized as rigid, automatic,
              unconscious, and opposed to goal-directed actions. This analysis
              leaves unexplained several aspects of human behavior and
              cognition where habits are of great importance. We intend to
              demonstrate the utility that another philosophical conception of
              habit, the Aristotelian, may have for neuroscientific research.
              We first summarize the current notion of habit in neuroscience,
              its philosophical inspiration and the problems that arise from
              it, mostly centered on the sharp distinction between
              goal-directed actions and habitual behavior. We then introduce
              the Aristotelian view and we compare it with that of William
              James. For Aristotle, a habit is an acquired disposition to
              perform certain types of action. If this disposition involves an
              enhanced cognitive control of actions, it can be considered a
              ``habit-as-learning''. The current view of habit in neuroscience,
              which lacks cognitive control and we term ``habit-as-routine'',
              is also covered by the Aristotelian conception. He classifies
              habits into three categories: (1) theoretical, or the retention
              of learning understood as ``knowing that x is so''; (2)
              behavioral, through which the agent achieves a rational control
              of emotion-permeated behavior (``knowing how to behave''); and
              (3) technical or learned skills (``knowing how to make or to
              do''). Finally, we propose new areas of research where this
              ``novel'' conception of habit could serve as a framework concept,
              from the cognitive enrichment of actions to the role of habits in
              pathological conditions. In all, this contribution may shed light
              on the understanding of habits as an important feature of human
              action. Habits, viewed as a cognitive enrichment of behavior, are

              this article that the challenge for memory research consists not
              merely in the (possible) loss of meaning entailed by transforming
              embedded recollected experiences into operationalized cognitive
              functions. Rather, from the outset, the first-person experiential
              basis of the entire research procedure is often insufficiently
              elaborated and hence risks neglecting or misrepresenting
              significant dimensions of the phenomena it studies. I demonstrate
              this with regard to habits understood as procedural memories.
              Research based on the paradigm of embodied cognition and
              phenomenology has shown that procedural memory-based skills and
              habits are not necessarily confined to sub-personal (unconscious)
              processing mechanisms. This paradigm states that some cognitive
              processes involve not only the brain but also the
              pre-reflectively experienced lived-body. The key idea is that we
              have experiential access to bodily processes that are not yet
              conceptualized or reflexively mediated. In the final part of my
              paper, I delineate how such experiences can be integrated into
              the neuropsychological study of habits via the method of
              'front-loaded phenomenology.'",

              of simple learning and decision-making tasks. However, one
              challenge in the study of RL is computational: The simplicity of
              these tasks ignores important aspects of reinforcement learning
              in the real world: (a) State spaces are high-dimensional,
              continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (b) data
              are relatively sparse and, indeed, precisely the same situation
              may never be encountered twice; furthermore, (c) rewards depend
              on the long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the
              classical assumptions that make RL tractable. A seemingly
              distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of RL have
              largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which
              knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually
              from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic
              memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic
              memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest
              that these two challenges are related. The computational
              challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing RL systems with
              episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efficiently approximate
              value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very
              little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between
              actions and rewards. We review the computational theory
              underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support
              it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles
              of memory in RL may function as part of an integrated learning

              role expectation plays in modulating the way novelty affects
              memory processes, circuits, and subsequent performance. We first
              review independent effects of expectation on memory, and then
              consider how different types of novelty are characterised by
              expectation. We argue that different types of novelty defined by

              different types of memory. Contextual novelty, which is

              effects of novelty, both before and after learning, and could
              show that hippocampus-dependent dopaminergic neuromodulation
              plays an important role. Here, we further investigated the
              effects of novelty on long-term memory in humans using a novel
              paradigm employing short sequences of nature movies presented
              either before or at two time points after learning of unrelated
              words. Since novelty processing is associated with a release of
              dopamine into the hippocampus, we hypothesized that novelty
              exposure primarily affects hippocampus-dependent memory (i.e.,
              recollection) but not hippocampus-independent memory (i.e.,
              familiarity). We tested 182 healthy human subjects in three
              experiments including a word-learning task followed by a 1-day
              delayed recognition task. Importantly, participants were exposed
              to novel (NOV) or familiar movies (FAM) at three time points:
              (experiment 1) directly after encoding of the word list,
              (experiment 2) 15 min after encoding, (experiment 3) 15 min prior

              interesting and led to better mood. During word recognition,
              reaction times were faster for remember as compared to
              familiarity responses in all three experiments, but this effect
              was not modulated by novelty. In contrast to our main hypothesis,
              there was no effect of novelty - before or after encoding - on
              subsequent word recognition, including recollection and
              familiarity scores. Therefore, an exposure to novel movies
              without an active task does not affect hippocampus-dependent and

              novelty, interactions across the VTA-hippocampal circuit support
              experience-dependent plasticity in the hippocampus. While
              theories have broadly suggested plasticity-related changes are
              also instantiated in the cortex, research has also shown evidence
              for functional heterogeneity in cortical networks. It therefore
              remains unclear how the hippocampal-VTA circuit engages cortical
              networks, and whether novelty targets specific cortical regions
              or diffuse, large-scale cortical networks. To adjudicate the role
              of the VTA and hippocampus in cortical network plasticity, we
              used fMRI to compare resting-state functional coupling before and
              following exposure to novel scene images in human subjects of
              both sexes. Functional coupling between right anterior
              hippocampus and VTA was enhanced following novelty exposure.
              However, we also found evidence for a double dissociation, with
              anterior hippocampus and VTA showing distinct patterns of
              post-novelty functional coupling enhancements, targeting
              task-relevant regions versus large-scale networks, respectively.
              Further, significant correlations between these networks and the
              novelty-related plasticity in the anterior hippocampal-VTA
              functional network suggest that the central hippocampal-VTA

              detection is critical for adaptive behavior, signaling the need
              to update existing representations. By engaging the bidirectional
              hippocampal-VTA circuit, novelty has been shown to induce
              plasticity-related changes in the hippocampus. However, it
              remains an open question how novelty targets such
              plasticity-related changes in cortical networks. We show that
              anterior hippocampus and VTA target cortical networks at
              different spatial scales, with respective enhancements in
              post-novelty functional coupling with a task-relevant cortical

              recently been described that is, we argue, relevant to the role
              of LTP in information storage. Specifically, new results indicate
              that a particular pattern of synaptic activation can give rise,
              either to a relatively short-lasting LTP, or to a longer-lasting
              LTP as a function of the history of activation of the neuron.
              This has led to the idea that the induction of LTP is associated
              with the setting of a'synaptic tag' at activated synapses, whose
              role is to sequester plasticity-related proteins that then serve
              to stabilize temporary synaptic changes and so extend their
              persistence. In this article, we outline the synaptic tag
              hypothesis, compare predictions it makes with those of other
              theories about the persistence of LTP, and speculate about the
              cellular identity of the tag. In addition, we outline the
              requirement for aminergic activation to induce late LTP and

              protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (late-LTP) may
              be realised. The synaptic tag hypothesis (Frey and Morris, 1997)
              predicts that the expression of early-LTP following a weak
              tetanus can be stabilised into late-LTP by subsequent strong
              tetanisation of a separate pathway, provided the interval between
              the two tetanisation episodes is within the decay time-course of
              a putative synaptic tag. An alternative plasticity-factors
              hypothesis requires that strong tetanisation should always
              precede weak tetanisation for stabilisation of early-LTP to
              occur. Our results indicate that weak tetanisation of pathway S2
              at intervals of 5 min or 1 h prior to strong tetanisation on
              pathway S1 does result in late-LTP on pathway S2. Stabilisation

              stabilisation effect was shown to depend on protein synthesis

              meta-analytic comparison of functional neuroimaging studies
              involving EM and IM tasks. The meta-analysis comprised two
              separate meta-analytic comparisons. First, to compare EM and IM
              in terms of encoding activity, subsequent memory effects
              (remembered > forgotten) and repetition suppression effects
              (first > repeated) were directly compared. Second, to compare EM
              and IM in terms of retrieval activity, retrieval success effects
              (hit > correct rejection) and repetition suppression effects were
              directly compared. Based on the notion that reduced activity
              during repeated processing is a 'by-product' or direct
              consequence of the stimulus processing performed in the same
              regions at initial exposure, regions showing repetition
              suppression were thought to play an important role in both
              IM-encoding and IM-retrieval activities. The results indicated
              that subsequent memory and repetition suppression effects had
              extensive overlaps and no significant separations, suggesting
              that EM- and IM-encoding activities involve largely common
              regions. Retrieval success and repetition suppression effects had
              strong segregations and only modest overlaps, suggesting that EM-
              and IM-retrieval activities involve largely separate regions.
              Consistent with these results, Explicit/Implicit Memory Encoding
              and Retrieval (EIMER), a neurocognitive model of EM and IM that
              suggests a common-encoding, separate-retrieval hypothesis for EM
              and IM is proposed herein.",

              considerable interest across multiple disciplines. Previous
              research has typically shown that repeating the same action on
              consecutive trials enhances short-term performance but has
              detrimental effects on longer term skill acquisition. However,
              most prior research has contrasted the effects of repetition only
              at the block level; in the current study we examined the effects
              of repeating individual trials embedded in a larger randomized
              block, a feature that is often overlooked when random trial
              orders are generated in learning tasks. With 4 days of practice,
              a ``Minimal Repeats'' group, who rarely experienced repeating
              stimuli on consecutive trials during training, improved to a
              greater extent than a ``Frequent Repeats'' group, who were
              frequently presented with repeating stimuli on consecutive trials
              during training. Our results extend the previous finding of the
              beneficial effects of random compared with blocked practice on
              performance, showing that reduced trial-to-trial repetition
              during training is favorable with regard to skill learning. This
              research highlights that limiting the number of repeats on
              consecutive trials is a simple behavioral manipulation that can
              enhance the process of skill learning. Data/analysis code and

              learning. We examined whether the same effect would occur on a
              trial-to-trial level. Our Minimal Repeats group, who primarily
              responded to different stimuli on consecutive trials, learned
              more than our Frequent Repeats group, who frequently responded to
              the same stimulus on consecutive trials. This shows that

              which the first steps of this transition take place. We
              hypothesized that the neural representations of initially novel
              items gradually change over the course of repeated presentations,
              expressing a shift toward familiarity. We further assumed that
              this shift could be traced by examining neural patterns using
              fMRI. In two experiments, while being scanned, participants read
              noun-adjective word pairs that were either consistent or
              inconsistent with their prior knowledge. Stimuli were repeated
              3-6 times within the scans. Employing mass univariate and
              multivariate similarity analyses, we showed that the neural
              representations associated with the initial presentation of
              familiar versus novel objects differed in lateral frontal and
              temporal regions, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the medial
              temporal lobe. Importantly, the neural representations of novel
              stimuli gradually changed throughout repetitions until they
              became indistinguishable from their respective familiar items. We
              interpret these findings as indicating that an early phase of
              familiarization can be completed within a few repetitions. This
              initial familiarization can then serve as the prerequisite to the

               In this new frequency-specific representation of cortical
               activity, that we call `connectome harmonics', oscillatory
               networks of the human brain at rest match harmonic wave patterns

              called long-term potentiation (LTP)-the primary cellular model of
              memory in the mammalian brain. An early phase of LTP (lasting
              less than three hours) can be dissociated from late-phase LTP by
              using inhibitors of transcription and translation, Because
              protein synthesis occurs mainly in the cell body, whereas LTP is
              input-specific, the question arises of how the synapse
              specificity of late LTP is achieved without elaborate
              intracellular protein trafficking. We propose that LTP initiates
              the creation of a short-lasting protein-synthesis-independent
              'synaptic tag' at the potentiated synapse which sequesters the
              relevant protein(s) to establish late LTP. In support of this
              idea, we now show that weak tetanic stimulation, which ordinarily
              leads only to early LTP, or repeated tetanization in the presence
              of protein-synthesis inhibitors, each results in
              protein-synthesis-dependent late LTP, provided repeated
              tetanization has already been applied at another input to the
              same population of neurons. The synaptic tag decays in less than
              three hours. These findings indicate that the persistence of LTP

              during the last two decades, researchers have discovered specific
              temporal windows around learning, during which the intervention
              with some experiences induces modulatory effects on the formation
              and/or persistence of memory. Based on these results, the aim of
              the present study was to design a specific strategy to improve
              the memory of students in a high-school scenario, by assessing
              the effect of a novel situation experienced close to learning. We
              found that the long-term memory about a geometrical figure was
              more precise in the group of students that faced a novel
              situation 1 h before or after learning the figure than the
              control group of students who did not face the novelty. This
              enhancement was probably triggered by processes acting on memory
              formation mechanisms that remained evident 45 days after
              learning, indicating that the improvement was sustained over

              was faced around 10 h after learning, the novel experience
              improved the memory persistence tested 7 days later. In summary,

              development affected the nature of cortical inputs to the

              cortico-hippocampal connectivity using intrinsic functional
              connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in awake mice and humans. We found that

              sensory mapping within the mouse parahippocampal region.
              Moreover, we identified a similar topographical modality-specific
              organization along the longitudinal axis of the mouse

  abstract = "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is activity-dependent enhancement of
              synaptic strength that can critically regulate long-term memory
              storage. Like memory, LTP exhibits at least two mechanistically
              distinct temporal phases. Early LTP (E-LTP) does not require
              protein synthesis, whereas the late phase of LTP (L-LTP), like
              long-term memory, requires protein synthesis. Hippocampal
              beta-adrenergic receptors can regulate expression of both E-LTP
              and long-term memory. Although beta-adrenergic receptor
              activation enhances the ability of subthreshold stimuli to induce
              E-LTP, it is unclear whether such activation can facilitate
              induction of L-LTP. Here, we use electrophysiological recording
              methods on mouse hippocampal slices to show that when synaptic
              stimulation that is subthreshold for inducing L-LTP is paired
              with beta-adrenergic receptor activation, the resulting LTP
              persists for over 6 h in area CA1. Like L-LTP induced by multiple
              trains of high-frequency electrical stimulation, this LTP
              requires protein synthesis. Unlike tetanus-induced L-LTP,
              however, L-LTP induced by beta-adrenergic receptor activation
              during subthreshold stimulation appears to involve dendritic
              protein synthesis but not somatic transcription. Maintenance of
              this LTP also requires activation of extracellular

              activation elicits a type of L-LTP that requires translation and
              ERK activation but not transcription. This form of L-LTP may be a
              cellular mechanism for facilitation of behavioral long-term

               electrophysiological-induced plasticity changes. Ten years
               later, the same argument was applied on learning and memory
               models to explain the formation of long-term memories, resulting
               in the behavioral tagging hypothesis (BT). These hypotheses are
               able to explain how a weak event that induces transient changes
               in the brain can establish long-lasting phenomena through a
               tagging and capture process. In this framework, it was
               postulated that the weak event sets a tag that captures
               plasticity-related proteins/products (PRPs) synthesized by an
               independent strong event. The tagging and capture processes
               exhibit symmetry, and therefore, PRPs can be captured if they
               are synthesized either before or after the setting of the tag.
               In summary, the hypothesis provides a wide framework that gives
               a solid explanation of how lasting changes occur and how the
               interaction between different events leads to promotion,

              exert an enhancing effect on learning and memory within the
              school environment. Here we show that novel experience improved
              the memory of literary or graphical activities when it is close
              to these learning sessions. We found memory improvements in
              groups of students who had experienced a novel science lesson 1
              hour before or after the reading of a story, but not when these
              events were 4 hours apart. Such promoting effect on long-term
              memory (LTM) was also reproduced with another type of novelty (a
              music lesson) and also after another type of learning task (a
              visual memory). Interestingly, when the lesson was familiar, it

              unsuccessful treatment (i.e., limited within-treatment
              abstinence), or for relapse following treatment, are needed to
              improve outcomes. Cumulatively, the literature generally supports
              the hypothesis that individual differences in brain function and
              structure are linked to differences in treatment outcomes,
              although anatomical loci and directions of associations have
              differed across studies. However, this work has almost entirely
              used methods that may overfit the data, leading to inflated
              effect size estimates and reduced likelihood of reproducibility
              in novel clinical samples. In contrast, cross-validated
              predictive modeling (i.e., machine learning) approaches are
              designed to overcome limitations of traditional approaches by
              focusing on individual differences and generalization to novel
              subjects (i.e., cross-validation), thereby increasing the
              likelihood of replication and potential translation to novel
              clinical settings. Here, we review recent studies using these

              information but impairs processing of other information. Here, we
              propose that, under arousal, local glutamate levels signal the
              current strength of a representation and interact with
              norepinephrine (NE) to enhance high priority representations and
              out-compete or suppress lower priority representations. In our
              ``glutamate amplifies noradrenergic effects'' (GANE) model, high
              glutamate at the site of prioritized representations increases
              local NE release from the locus coeruleus (LC) to generate ``NE
              hotspots.'' At these NE hotspots, local glutamate and NE release
              are mutually enhancing and amplify activation of prioritized
              representations. In contrast, arousal-induced LC activity
              inhibits less active representations via two mechanisms: 1) Where
              there are hotspots, lateral inhibition is amplified; 2) Where no
              hotspots emerge, NE levels are only high enough to activate
              low-threshold inhibitory adrenoreceptors. Thus, LC activation
              promotes a few hotspots of excitation in the context of
              widespread suppression, enhancing high priority representations
              while suppressing the rest. Hotspots also help synchronize
              oscillations across neural ensembles transmitting high-priority
              information. Furthermore, brain structures that detect stimulus
              priority interact with phasic NE release to preferentially route
              such information through large-scale functional brain networks. A
              surge of NE before, during, or after encoding enhances synaptic
              plasticity at NE hotspots, triggering local protein synthesis
              processes that enhance selective memory consolidation. Together,
              these noradrenergic mechanisms promote selective attention and

              suggests the existence of such a mechanism that selectively
              strengthens weak memories for neutral stimuli from one category
              when their respective category gains motivational significance

              data from four attempts to replicate category-specific
              retroactive memory enhancements for neutral stimuli from a
              category that was later predictive of aversive electric shocks.

              novel circumstances is highly adaptive. However, the neural
              correlates of flexible associative inference are not well
              characterized. Laboratory tests of associative inference have
              measured memory for overlapping pairs of studied items (e.g., AB,
              BC) and for nonstudied pairs with common associates (i.e., AC).
              Findings from functional neuroimaging and neuropsychology suggest
              the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) may be necessary for
              associative inference. Here, we used a neuropsychological
              approach to test the necessity of vmPFC for successful
              memory-guided associative inference in humans using an
              overlapping pairs associative memory task. We predicted that
              individuals with focal vmPFC damage (n = 5; 3F, 2M) would show
              impaired inferential memory but intact non-inferential memory.
              Performance was compared with normal comparison participants (n =
              10; 6F, 4M). Participants studied pairs of visually presented
              objects including overlapping pairs (AB, BC) and nonoverlapping
              pairs (XY). Participants later completed a three-alternative
              forced-choice recognition task for studied pairs (AB, BC, XY) and
              inference pairs (AC). As predicted, the vmPFC group had intact
              memory for studied pairs but significantly impaired memory for
              inferential pairs. These results are consistent with the
              perspective that the vmPFC is necessary for memory-guided
              associative inference, indicating that the vmPFC is critical for
              adaptive abilities that require application of existing knowledge
              to novel circumstances. Additionally, vmPFC damage was associated
              with unexpectedly reduced memory for AB pairs post-inference,
              which could potentially reflect retroactive interference.
              Together, these results reinforce an emerging understanding of a
              role for the vmPFC in brain networks supporting associative
              memory processes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We live in a constantly
              changing environment, so the ability to adapt our knowledge to
              support understanding of new circumstances is essential. One
              important adaptive ability is associative inference which allows
              us to extract shared features from distinct experiences and
              relate them. For example, if we see a woman holding a baby, and
              later see a man holding the same baby, then we might infer that
              the two adults are a couple. Despite the importance of
              associative inference, the brain systems necessary for this
              ability are not known. Here, we report that damage to human
              ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) disproportionately impairs

               days, rats were given one trial per day to find food in
               different places and later had to recall that day's location.
               This task is both hippocampus and NMDA receptor dependent.
               First, encoding with low reward induced place memory that
               decayed over 24 h; in parallel, weak tetanization of CA1
               synapses in brain slices induced early-LTP fading to baseline.
               Second, novelty exploration scheduled 30 min after this weak
               encoding resulted in persistent place memory; similarly, strong
               tetanization--analogous to novelty--both induced late-LTP and
               rescued early- into late-LTP on an independent but convergent
               pathway. Third, hippocampal dopamine D1/D5 receptor blockade or
               protein synthesis inhibition within 15 min of exploration
               prevented persistent place memory and blocked late-LTP. Fourth,
               symmetrically, when spatial memory was encoded using strong
               reward, this memory persisted for 24 h unless encoding occurred
               under hippocampal D1/D5 receptor blockade. Novelty exploration
               before this encoding rescued the drug-induced memory impairment.
               Parallel effects were observed in LTP. These findings can be
               explained by the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis.",

              protein synthesis in the hippocampus during a novel experience
              are crucial for this novelty-induced memory boost. The mechanisms

              However, the processes involved in encoding and retrieving
              temporal information across extended sequences is relatively

              retrieval of extended sequences to test specific predictions
              about the type of information used to resolve temporal order and
              the role of the hippocampus in this process. Participants studied
              sequences of images of celebrity faces and common objects
              followed by a recency discrimination test. The main conditions of
              interest were pairs of items that had been presented with three

  abstract = "Pain is an unfortunate consequence of many medical procedures,

              the factors affecting medical pain, clinician-patient (C-P)
              similarity and nonverbal communication are particularly important
              for pain diagnosis and treatment. Participants (N = 66) were
              randomly assigned to clinician and patient roles and were grouped
              into C-P dyads. Clinicians administered painful stimuli to
              patients as an analogue of a painful medical procedure. We
              manipulated the perceived C-P similarity of each dyad using
              groups ostensibly based on shared beliefs and values, and each
              patient was tested twice: Once with a same group clinician
              (concordant, CC) and once with a clinician from the other group
              (discordant, DC). Movement synchrony was calculated as a marker
              of nonverbal communication. We tested whether movement synchrony
              mediated the effects of group concordance on patients' pain and
              trust in the clinician. Movement synchrony was higher in CC than
              DC dyads. Higher movement synchrony predicted reduced pain and
              increased trust in the clinician. Movement synchrony also
              formally mediated the group concordance effects on pain and
              trust. These findings increase our understanding of the role of
              nonverbal C-P communication on pain and related outcomes.
              Interpersonal synchrony may be associated with better pain
              outcomes, independent of the specific treatment provided.
              PERSPECTIVE: This article demonstrates that movement synchrony in
              C-P interactions is an unobtrusive measure related to their
              relationship quality, trust toward the clinician, and pain. These

              with better patient outcomes, independent of the specific

              thought to be mediated by postencoding reactivation or the
              reexpression of activity patterns that characterize prior
              encoding experiences during subsequent offline periods. Although
              hippocampal reactivation has been well-described in the rodent,
              evidence for postencoding persistence of hippocampal encoding
              patterns has yet to be described in humans. Using functional MRI,
              we examined the persistence of multivoxel hippocampal encoding
              patterns into postencoding rest periods. To characterize activity
              patterns, we computed the pairwise multivoxel correlation
              structure (MVCS) across hippocampal voxels during two distinct
              encoding tasks as well as during pre- and postencoding rest
              periods. We found that the hippocampal MVCS for each encoding
              task was more similar to the MVCS during immediate postencoding
              rest periods compared with a preencoding, baseline rest period.
              Additionally, using a principal component decomposition approach,
              we found that the strongest encoding patterns showed evidence of
              preferential persistence into immediate postencoding rest

              patterns showed evidence of preferential persistence into
              immediate postencoding rest significantly correlated with later
              memory for stimuli seen during encoding. Taken together, these

               an object session in which a novel object was placed in one of
               the two holes. During the habituation session, when the whole
               environment was unfamiliar, there was a phasic response the
               first time the rat visited any hole, which habituated after one
               visit. During the second session, when one of the holes

               novel object. There was no response to empty holes in this

              models, although continually improving, do not yet reach human
              performance. It is unclear to what extent the internal
              representations of computational models can explain the IT
              representation. Here we investigate a wide range of computational
              model representations (37 in total), testing their categorization
              performance and their ability to account for the IT
              representational geometry. The models include well-known
              neuroscientific object-recognition models (e.g. HMAX, VisNet)
              along with several models from computer vision (e.g. SIFT, GIST,
              self-similarity features, and a deep convolutional neural
              network). We compared the representational dissimilarity matrices
              (RDMs) of the model representations with the RDMs obtained from
              human IT (measured with fMRI) and monkey IT (measured with cell
              recording) for the same set of stimuli (not used in training the
              models). Better performing models were more similar to IT in that
              they showed greater clustering of representational patterns by
              category. In addition, better performing models also more
              strongly resembled IT in terms of their within-category
              representational dissimilarities. Representational geometries
              were significantly correlated between IT and many of the models.
              However, the categorical clustering observed in IT was largely
              unexplained by the unsupervised models. The deep convolutional
              network, which was trained by supervision with over a million
              category-labeled images, reached the highest categorization
              performance and also best explained IT, although it did not fully
              explain the IT data. Combining the features of this model with
              appropriate weights and adding linear combinations that maximize
              the margin between animate and inanimate objects and between
              faces and other objects yielded a representation that fully
              explained our IT data. Overall, our results suggest that
              explaining IT requires computational features trained through

  abstract = "We build on the existing biased competition view to argue that
              attention is an emergent property of neural computations within
              and across hierarchically embedded and structurally connected
              cortical pathways. Critically then, one must ask, what is
              attention emergent from? Within this framework, developmental
              changes in the quality of sensory input and feedforward-feedback
              information flow shape the emergence and efficiency of attention.
              Several gradients of developing structural and functional
              cortical architecture across the caudal-to-rostral axis provide
              the substrate for attention to emerge. Neural activity within
              visual areas depends on neuronal density, receptive field size,
              tuning properties of neurons, and the location of and competition
              between features and objects in the visual field. These visual
              cortical properties highlight the information processing
              bottleneck attention needs to resolve. Recurrent feedforward and
              feedback connections convey sensory information through a series
              of steps at each level of the cortical hierarchy, integrating
              sensory information across the entire extent of the cortical
              hierarchy and linking sensory processing to higher-order brain
              regions. Higher-order regions concurrently provide input
              conveying behavioral context and goals. Thus, attention reflects
              the output of a series of complex biased competition neural
              computations that occur within and across hierarchically embedded
              cortical regions. Cortical development proceeds along the

              altering how we represent our past. Event segmentation theory
              proposes that clustering ongoing experience in this way is
              adaptive in that it promotes efficient online processing as well
              as later reconstruction of relevant information. A growing
              literature supports this theory by demonstrating its important
              behavioral consequences. Yet the exact mechanisms of segmentation
              remain elusive. Here, we provide a brief overview of how event
              segmentation influences ongoing processing, subsequent memory
              retrieval, and decision making as well as some proposed
              underlying mechanisms. We then explore how beliefs, or

              changes, creating an event boundary. This offers an alternative
              to dominant theories of event segmentation, allowing boundaries
              to occur independent of perceptual change and even when
              transitions are predictable. We describe how this framework can

              appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon
              who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most
              important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and
              associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with
              paralyzed or comatose patients via brain--computer interfaces, it
              is most important to accurately extract the neural processes
              specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but
              complementary objectives require different analysis methods.
              Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from
              the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a
              forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured
              data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general
              linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural
              information from data can be considered as backward models, as
              they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are
              multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters
              of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the
              sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at
              channels the activity of which is related to the brain process
              under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model
              parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or
              temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since
              significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the
              activity of which is statistically independent of the brain

              independent component analysis have been used to identify the
              brain networks shaping functional connectivity (FC). Importantly,
              these approaches are static in the sense that they ignore the
              temporal information contained in fMRI time series. Therefore,
              the corresponding components provide a static characterization of
              FC. Building upon recent findings suggesting that FC dynamics
              encode richer information about brain functional organization, we
              use a dynamic extension of component analysis to identify dynamic
              modes (DMs) of fMRI time series. We demonstrate the feasibility
              and relevance of this approach using resting-state and motor-task

              hippocampal involvement. These studies measured perception as a

              has challenged this notion by demonstrating that this region can
              contribute to many domains of cognition beyond long-term memory,
              including perception and attention. One potential reason why the
              MTL (and hippocampus specifically) contributes broadly to
              cognition is that it contains relational
              representations-representations of multidimensional features of
              experience and their unique relationship to one another-that are
              useful in many different cognitive domains. Here, we explore the
              hypothesis that the hippocampus/MTL plays a critical role in
              attention and perception via relational representations. We
              compared human participants with MTL damage to healthy age- and
              education-matched individuals on attention tasks that varied in
              relational processing demands. On each trial, participants viewed
              two images (rooms with paintings). On ``similar room'' trials,

              different perspective. On ``similar art'' trials, they judged
              whether the paintings could have been painted by the same artist.
              On ``identical'' trials, participants simply had to detect
              identical paintings or rooms. MTL lesion patients were
              significantly and selectively impaired on the similar room task.
              This work provides further evidence that the hippocampus/MTL
              plays a ubiquitous role in cognition by virtue of its relational

              distorted by environmental modifications (see the Perspective by
              Quian Quiroga). Butler et al. compared grid cell coding during a
              free-foraging task and a spatial memory task in rats. They
              discovered that entorhinal spatial maps restructure to
              incorporate the location of a learned reward. Boccara et al.
              tested the influence of behaviorally relevant information on the
              cognitive map that emerges from grid cell firing in the rat
              medial entorhinal cortex. They found that grid cells participate
              in neural coding of the goal locality, not the whole environment.

              Grid cells with their rigid hexagonal firing fields are thought
              to provide an invariant metric to the hippocampal cognitive map,
              yet environmental geometrical features have recently been shown

              learn three new reward locations on a cheeseboard maze while
              recording from the medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal
              CA1 region. Many grid fields moved toward goal location, leading
              to long-lasting deformations of the entorhinal map. Therefore,
              distortions in the grid structure contribute to goal
              representation during both learning and recall, which

              enhance the ISC of brain activity during narratives include
              higher levels of attention, emotional arousal, and negative

              co-vary with activity in the temporoparietal junction, emotional

              imaging (fMRI) data. This method's principle advantage over

              functional connectivity between brain regions during distinct
              stages of a cognitive task. The method is implemented by using
              separate covariates to model the activity evoked during each
              stage of each individual trial in the context of the general
              linear model (GLM). The resulting parameter estimates (beta
              values) are sorted according to the stage from which they were
              derived to form a set of stage-specific beta series. Regions
              whose beta series are correlated during a given stage are
              inferred to be functionally interacting during that stage. To

              for reasons associated with statistical efficiency. Efficiency is
              calculated from the precision of the parameters (Betas) estimated
              from a General Linear Model (GLM) in which trial onsets are
              convolved with a Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF). However,
              previous calculations of efficiency have ignored likely
              variability in the neural response from trial to trial, for
              example due to attentional fluctuations, or different stimuli
              across trials. Here we compare three GLMs in their efficiency for
              estimating average and individual Betas across trials as a
              function of trial variability, scan noise and Stimulus Onset
              Asynchrony (SOA): ``Least Squares All'' (LSA), ``Least Squares
              Separate'' (LSS) and ``Least Squares Unitary'' (LSU). Estimation
              of responses to individual trials in particular is important for
              both functional connectivity using ``Beta-series correlation''
              and ``multi-voxel pattern analysis'' (MVPA). Our simulations show
              that the ratio of trial-to-trial variability to scan noise
              impacts both the optimal SOA and optimal GLM, especially for
              short SOAs<5s: LSA is better when this ratio is high, whereas LSS
              and LSU are better when the ratio is low. For MVPA, the
              consistency across voxels of trial variability and of scan noise
              is also critical. These findings not only have important
              implications for design of experiments using Beta-series
              regression and MVPA, but also statistical parametric mapping

              brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and
              computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to
              evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need
              to define the correspondency between the units of the model and
              the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell
              recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating
              activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity
              measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology),
              and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these
              divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns
              themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices
              (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given
              representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich
              psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis,
              we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework
              called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which
              multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively
              related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by
              comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of

              the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide
              range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via
              second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested
              using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the
              broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to
              experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep
              roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated
              quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus
              contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.",

              Although products of our neurons, they are only rarely accessible
              in humans at the neuronal level. Here I review insights gleaned
              from unique neurosurgical opportunities to record and stimulate

              former from medial temporal lobe reactivation and the latter from

              are themselves dependent (i.e. exhibit temporal autocorrelation),
              the effective degrees of freedom (EDF) are reduced, the standard
              error of the sample correlation coefficient is biased, and
              Fisher's transformation fails to stabilise the variance. Since
              fMRI time series are notoriously autocorrelated, the issue of
              biased standard errors - before or after Fisher's transformation
              - becomes vital in individual-level analysis of resting-state
              functional connectivity (rsFC) and must be addressed anytime a
              standardised Z-score is computed. We find that the severity of

              brain regions, such as the size of regions of interest and the
              spatial location of those regions. We further show that the

              not supported by the data, resulting in biased rsFC inferences
              that lead to distorted topological descriptions of the connectome
              on the individual level. We propose a practical ``xDF'' method
              that accounts not only for distinct autocorrelation in each time
              series, but instantaneous and lagged cross-correlation. We find
              the xDF correction varies substantially over node pairs,

              previously. In addition to extensive synthetic and real data

              hierarchical planning at multiple scales.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Whenever we navigate the world, we represent our journey at
              multiple horizons: from our immediate surroundings to our distal
              goal. How are such cognitive maps at different horizons
              simultaneously represented in the brain? Here, we applied a
              reinforcement learning-based analysis to neuroimaging data
              acquired while participants virtually navigated their hometown.
              We investigated neural patterns in the hippocampus and PFC, key
              cognitive map regions. We uncovered predictive representations
              with multiscale horizons in prefrontal and hippocampal gradients,
              with the longest predictive horizons in anterior PFC and the
              shortest in posterior hippocampus. These findings provide
              empirical support for the computational hypothesis that
              multiscale neural representations guide goal-directed navigation.
              This advances our understanding of hierarchical planning in
              everyday navigation of realistic distances.",

              distributed brain circuits. Although the contributions of
              individual regions to learning have been extensively
              investigated, much less is known about how distributed brain
              networks orchestrate their activity over the course of learning.
              To address this gap, we used fMRI combined with tools from
              dynamic network neuroscience to obtain time-resolved descriptions
              of network coordination during reinforcement learning in humans.
              We found that learning to associate visual cues with reward
              involves dynamic changes in network coupling between the striatum
              and distributed brain regions, including visual, orbitofrontal,
              and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (n = 22; 13 females).
              Moreover, we found that this flexibility in striatal network
              coupling correlates with participants' learning rate and inverse
              temperature, two parameters derived from reinforcement learning
              models. Finally, we found that episodic learning, measured
              separately in the same participants at the same time, was related
              to dynamic connectivity in distinct brain networks. These results
              suggest that dynamic changes in striatal-centered networks

              direction, and boundary cells, are thought to collectively
              instantiate cognitive maps supporting flexible navigation.
              However, to flexibly navigate, it is necessary to also maintain
              internal representations of goal locations, such that
              goal-directed routes can be planned and executed. Although it has
              remained unclear how the mammalian brain represents goal
              locations, multiple neural candidates have recently been
              uncovered during different phases of navigation. For example,
              during planning, sequential activation of spatial cells may
              enable simulation of future routes toward the goal. During
              travel, modulation of spatial cells by the prospective route, or
              by distance and direction to the goal, may allow maintenance of
              route and goal-location information, supporting navigation on an
              ongoing basis. As the goal is approached, an increased activation
              of spatial cells may enable the goal location to become
              distinctly represented within cognitive maps, aiding goal
              localization. Lastly, after arrival at the goal, sequential
              activation of spatial cells may represent the just-taken route,

              that functional MRI (fMRI), when coupled with multivariate data
              analysis techniques, might allow the presence or absence of
              individual memories to be detected from brain activity patterns.
              This could have profound implications for forensic investigations
              and legal proceedings, and thus the merits and limitations of
              such an approach are in critical need of empirical evaluation. We
              conducted two experiments to investigate whether neural
              signatures of recognition memory can be reliably decoded from
              fMRI data. In Exp. 1, participants were scanned while making
              explicit recognition judgments for studied and novel faces.
              Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed a robust ability to
              classify whether a given face was subjectively experienced as old
              or new, as well as whether recognition was accompanied by
              recollection, strong familiarity, or weak familiarity. Moreover,
              a participant's subjective mnemonic experiences could be reliably
              decoded even when the classifier was trained on the brain data

              was further evidenced in Exp. 2, which demonstrated that mnemonic
              decoding is poor when memory is indirectly (implicitly) probed.

              Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function
              to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has
              been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the
              success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of
              this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process
              in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution
              local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local
              minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to
              apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid
              global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is
              specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It
              substantially reduces the likelihood of producing
              misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The
              increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly
              used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition,
              the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of
              experiments with motion correction. These motion correction
              experiments also investigate how the results are affected by
              different cost functions and interpolation methods.",

              behavioral conditions. This method is distinguished in using
              asymmetric, multivariate, information-theoretical analysis, which
              captures not only directional and non-linear relationships, but
              also collective interactions. Importantly, the method is able to
              estimate multivariate information measures with only relatively

              learning models that are trained to predict outcomes in the
              world, integration should occur when two stimuli predict the same
              outcome. Numerous findings support this, but - paradoxically -
              some recent fMRI studies have found that pairing different
              stimuli with the same associate causes differentiation, not
              integration. To explain these and related findings, we argue that
              supervised learning needs to be supplemented with unsupervised
              learning that is driven by spreading activation in a U-shaped
              way, such that inactive memories are not modified, moderate
              activation of memories causes weakening (leading to
              differentiation), and higher activation causes strengthening
              (leading to integration).",

              temporal cortex while participants performed a task that

              that categorical attention modulated the connectivity of
              category-selective areas, but only with retinotopic areas that
              coded for the spatially attended location. Similarly, spatial

              Here, using resting-state functional MRI, we show that the

              become an increasingly important tool for studying brain

              commonly quantified by the correlation distance or the accuracy
              of a linear classifier. However, there are many different ways to
              measure pattern dissimilarity and little is known about their
              relative reliability. Here, we compare the reliability of three
              classes of dissimilarity measure: classification accuracy,
              Euclidean/Mahalanobis distance, and Pearson correlation distance.
              Using simulations and four real functional magnetic resonance
              imaging (fMRI) datasets, we demonstrate that continuous
              dissimilarity measures are substantially more reliable than the
              classification accuracy. The difference in reliability can be
              explained by two characteristics of classifiers: discretization
              and susceptibility of the discriminant function to shifts of the
              pattern ensemble between imaging runs. Reliability can be further
              improved through multivariate noise normalization for all

              patterns of response encode important information, as shown by
              multivariate pattern analysis. In the present article, we
              introduce and apply multivariate pattern dependence (MVPD): a
              technique to study the statistical dependence between brain
              regions in humans in terms of the multivariate relations between
              their patterns of responses. MVPD characterizes the responses in
              each brain region as trajectories in region-specific
              multidimensional spaces, and models the multivariate relationship
              between these trajectories. We applied MVPD to the posterior
              superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and to the fusiform face area

              Here we focus on how the combination of study design (order and
              spacing of trials) with pattern estimator impacts the Type I
              error rate of the subsequent pattern analysis. When Type I errors

              controlled false positive rates. The MVPA strategies examined are
              pattern classification and similarity, utilizing single trial

              focusing on the Least Squares Single and Least Square All pattern

              false positive rates of pattern similarity and classification
              analyses. It may seem intuitive that increasing the interstimulus

              simultaneous coarse and fine-grained neural information coding,
              capturing both gist and detail of an experience. The longitudinal
              axis of the hippocampus may provide a gradient of
              representational granularity in spatial and episodic memory in
              rodents and humans [1-8]. Rodent place cells in the ventral
              hippocampus exhibit significantly larger place fields and greater
              autocorrelation than those in the dorsal hippocampus [1, 9-11],
              which may underlie a coarser and slower changing representation
              of space [10, 12]. Recent evidence suggests that properties of
              cellular dynamics in rodents can be captured with fMRI in humans
              during spatial navigation [13] and conceptual learning [14].
              Similarly, mechanisms supporting granularity along the long axis
              may also be extrapolated to the scale of fMRI signal. Here, we
              provide the first evidence for separable scales of representation
              along the human hippocampal anteroposterior axis during
              navigation and rest by showing (1) greater similarity among voxel
              time courses and (2) higher temporal autocorrelation in anterior
              hippocampus (aHPC), relative to posterior hippocampus (pHPC), the
              human homologs of ventral and dorsal rodent hippocampus. aHPC
              voxels exhibited more similar activity at each time point and
              slower signal change over time than voxels in pHPC, consistent
              with place field organization in rodents. Importantly, similarity
              between voxels was related to navigational strategy and episodic
              memory. These findings provide evidence that the human
              hippocampus supports an anterior-to-posterior gradient of
              coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal representations, suggesting the
              existence of a cross-species mechanism, whereby lower neural

              FMRI data. This is often attempted by identifying a set of
              functional ``nodes'' (e.g., spatial ROIs or ICA maps) and then
              conducting a connectivity analysis between the nodes, based on
              the FMRI timeseries associated with the nodes. Analysis methods
              range from very simple measures that consider just two nodes at a
              time (e.g., correlation between two nodes' timeseries) to
              sophisticated approaches that consider all nodes simultaneously
              and estimate one global network model (e.g., Bayes net models).
              Many different methods are being used in the literature, but
              almost none has been carefully validated or compared for use on
              FMRI timeseries data. In this work we generate rich, realistic
              simulated FMRI data for a wide range of underlying networks,
              experimental protocols and problematic confounds in the data, in
              order to compare different connectivity estimation approaches.
              Our results show that in general correlation-based approaches can
              be quite successful, methods based on higher-order statistics are
              less sensitive, and lag-based approaches perform very poorly.
              More specifically: there are several methods that can give high
              sensitivity to network connection detection on good quality FMRI
              data, in particular, partial correlation, regularised inverse
              covariance estimation and several Bayes net methods; however,
              accurate estimation of connection directionality is more
              difficult to achieve, though Patel's $\tau$ can be reasonably
              successful. With respect to the various confounds added to the
              data, the most striking result was that the use of functionally
              inaccurate ROIs (when defining the network nodes and extracting
              their associated timeseries) is extremely damaging to network
              estimation; hence, results derived from inappropriate ROI
              definition (such as via structural atlases) should be regarded

              often modeled using a multivariate Gaussian distribution, with a
              mean vector and covariance matrix that are allowed to vary as the

              demonstrate the potential of the approach using human fMRI data
              during movie-watching data and a continuous experimental
              paradigm. The model was able to learn spatiotemporal patterns
              that supported 15-way movie-clip classification (∼90\%) at the
              level of brain regions, and binary classification of experimental
              conditions (∼60\%) at the level of voxels. The model was also

              extending connectivity to multivariate functions relating to the
              temporal dynamics of a region with the rest of the brain. The
              main technical challenges of such an approach are
              multidimensionality and its associated risk of overfitting or
              even the non-uniqueness of model solutions. To minimize these
              risks, and as an alternative to the more common dimensionality
              reduction methods, we propose using two regularized multivariate
              connectivity models. On the one hand, simple linear functions of
              all brain nodes were fitted with ridge regression. On the other

              disconnection, almost completely absent from the much less

              allowed detecting sex-specific differences. The generic framework

              voxels within regions of interest (ROIs). However, averaging
              across voxels may result in biased connectivity estimates when
              there is inhomogeneity within those ROIs, e.g., sub-regions that
              exhibit different patterns of functional connectivity or
              structural covariance. Here, we propose a new measure based on
              ``distance correlation''; a test of multivariate dependence of
              high dimensional vectors, which allows for both linear and
              non-linear dependencies. We used simulations to show how distance
              correlation out-performs Pearson correlation in the face of
              inhomogeneous ROIs. To evaluate this new measure on real data, we
              use resting-state fMRI scans and T1 structural scans from 2
              sessions on each of 214 participants from the Cambridge Centre
              for Ageing \& Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) project. Pearson correlation

              Moreover, we found that the similarity between functional

              However, it is still unknown whether consolidation of individual
              memory contents relies on reactivation of stimulus-specific
              neural representations in humans. Investigating stimulus-specific
              representations in humans is particularly difficult, but
              potentially feasible using multivariate pattern classification
              analysis (MVPA). Here, we show in healthy human participants that
              stimulus-specific activation patterns can indeed be identified
              with MVPA, that these patterns reoccur spontaneously during
              postlearning resting periods and sleep, and that the frequency of
              reactivation predicts subsequent memory for individual items. We
              conducted a paired-associate learning task with items and spatial
              positions and extracted stimulus-specific activity patterns by
              MVPA in a simultaneous electroencephalography and functional

              reactivation of stimulus-specific activity patterns during

              reactivation occurs in humans and is behaviorally relevant for
              stabilizing memory traces against interference. They move beyond
              previous studies because replay was investigated on the level of

              that the hippocampus signals prediction errors, but the
              hypothesized link to memory updating has not been demonstrated.
              In a human functional MRI study, we elicited mnemonic prediction
              errors by interrupting familiar narrative videos immediately
              before the expected endings. We found that prediction errors
              reversed the relationship between univariate hippocampal
              activation and memory: greater hippocampal activation predicted
              memory preservation after expected endings, but memory updating
              after surprising endings. In contrast to previous studies, we
              show that univariate activation was insufficient for
              understanding hippocampal prediction error signals. We explain
              this surprising finding by tracking both the evolution of
              hippocampal activation patterns and the connectivity between the
              hippocampus and neuromodulatory regions. We found that

              Prediction errors disrupted these sustained representations and
              the degree of disruption predicted memory updating. The
              relationship between hippocampal activation and subsequent memory
              depended on concurrent basal forebrain activation, supporting the
              idea that cholinergic modulation regulates attention and memory.
              We conclude that prediction errors create conditions that favor

              that particularly recruits hippocampus-dependent computations of
              spatial locations and associations. Applying representational
              similarity analysis to functional magnetic resonance imaging

              update our knowledge to promote a more accurate representation of

              into a distinct memory trace to prevent interference with
              previous, conflicting memories. We investigated this proposal by
              repeatedly exposing participants to pairs of sequentially
              presented objects (A $\rightarrow$ B), thus evoking expectations.
              Then, we violated participants' expectations by replacing the
              second object in the pairs with a novel object (A $\rightarrow$
              C). The following item memory test required participants to
              discriminate between identical old items and similar lures, thus
              testing detailed and distinctive item memory representations. In
              two experiments, mnemonic prediction errors enhanced item memory:
              Participants correctly identified more old items as old when
              those items violated expectations during learning, compared with
              items that did not violate expectations. This memory enhancement
              for C items was only observed when participants later showed
              intact memory for the related A $\rightarrow$ B pairs, suggesting
              that strong predictions are required to facilitate memory for
              violations. Following up on this, a third experiment reduced
              prediction strength prior to violation and subsequently
              eliminated the memory advantage of violations. Interestingly,
              mnemonic prediction errors did not increase gist-based mistakes

              lures as old. Enhanced item memory in the absence of gist-based
              mistakes suggests that violations enhanced memory for items'
              details, which could be mediated via distinct memory traces.

              connectivity with other regions. These findings suggest that the
              hippocampus is a sophisticated learner of environmental

              learned contingencies. For instance, responses could be guided by
              the direct association between a stimulus and response, or by
              sequential stimulus-stimulus relationships (as in model-based
              reinforcement learning or goal-directed actions). However, the
              neural architecture underlying sequential predictive learning is
              not well understood, in part because it is difficult to isolate
              its effect on choice behavior. To track such learning more
              directly, we examined reaction times (RTs) in a probabilistic
              sequential picture identification task in healthy individuals. We
              used computational learning models to isolate trial-by-trial
              effects of two distinct learning processes in behavior, and used
              these as signatures to analyse the separate neural substrates of
              each process. RTs were best explained via the combination of two
              delta rule learning processes with different learning rates. To
              examine neural manifestations of these learning processes, we
              used functional magnetic resonance imaging to seek correlates of
              time-series related to expectancy or surprise. We observed such

              understood. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              studies employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have shown
              that a currently relevant task set can be decoded from activity
              patterns in the frontoparietal cortex, but whether these regions
              support the dynamic transformation of task sets from trial to
              trial is not clear. Here, we combined a cued task-switching
              protocol with human (both sexes) fMRI, and harnessed
              representational similarity analysis (RSA) to facilitate a novel
              assessment of trial-by-trial changes in neural task-set
              representations. We first used MVPA to define task-sensitive
              frontoparietal and visual regions and found that neural task-set
              representations on switch trials are less stably encoded than on
              repeat trials. We then exploited RSA to show that the neural
              representational pattern dissimilarity across consecutive trials
              is greater for switch trials than for repeat trials, and that the
              degree of this pattern dissimilarity predicts behavior. Moreover,
              the overall neural pattern of representational dissimilarities
              followed from the assumption that repeating sets, compared with
              switching sets, results in stronger neural task representations.
              Finally, when moving from cue to target phase within a trial,
              pattern dissimilarities tracked the transformation from
              previous-trial task representations to the currently relevant
              set. These results provide neural evidence for the longstanding
              assumptions of an effortful task-set reconfiguration process
              hampered by task-set inertia, and they demonstrate that
              frontoparietal and stimulus processing regions support ``dynamic
              adaptive coding,'' flexibly representing changing task sets in a
              trial-by-trial fashion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans can fluently
              switch between different tasks, reflecting an ability to
              dynamically configure ``task sets,'' rule representations that
              link stimuli to appropriate responses. Recent studies show that
              neural signals in frontal and parietal brain regions can tell us
              which of two tasks a person is currently performing. However, it
              is not known whether these regions are also involved in
              dynamically reconfiguring task-set representations when switching
              between tasks. Here we measured human brain activity during task
              switching and tracked the similarity of neural task-set
              representations from trial to trial. We show that frontal and
              parietal brain regions flexibly recode changing task sets in a
              trial-by-trial fashion, and that task-set similarity over
              consecutive trials predicts behavior.",

              populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate
              brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor
              responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context,
              representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the
              distribution of activity profiles across experimental conditions.
              Currently, three different methods are being used to test such
              hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component modeling (PCM),
              and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop a
              common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship
              of these three methods, which share one core commonality: all
              three evaluate the second moment of the distribution of activity
              profiles, which determines the representational geometry, and
              thus how well any feature can be decoded from population
              activity. Using simulated data for three different experimental
              designs, we compare the power of the methods to adjudicate
              between competing representational models. PCM implements a
              likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful
              test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two
              approaches-when conducted appropriately-can perform similarly. In
              encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately
              regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on the activity
              profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model specifies a
              well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA, the
              unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the
              dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach
              near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render
              different aspects of the information explicit (e.g.
              single-response tuning in encoding analysis and
              population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and
              have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease
              of use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly

  abstract = "Episodic memory allows people to reexperience the past by
              recovering the sequences of events that characterize those prior
              experiences. Although experience is continuous, people are able
              to selectively retrieve and reexperience more discrete episodes
              from their past, raising the possibility that some elements
              become tightly related to each other in memory, whereas others do
              not. The current series of experiments was designed to ask how
              shifts in context during an experience influence how people
              remember the past. Specifically, we asked how context shifts
              influence the ability to remember the relative order of past
              events, a hallmark of episodic memory. We found that memory for
              the order of events was enhanced within, rather than across,
              context shifts, or boundaries (Experiment 1). Next, we showed
              that this relative enhancement in order memory was eliminated
              when across-item associative processing was disrupted (Experiment
              2), suggesting that context shifts have a selective effect on
              sequential binding. Finally, we provide evidence that the act of
              making order memory judgments involves the reactivation of
              representations that bridged the tested items (Experiment 3).
              Together, these data suggest that boundaries may serve to parse
              continuous experience into sequences of contextually related

              remembered? Evidence suggests that people perceive their
              experience as a series of distinct and meaningful events.
              Information encountered within the same event shows greater
              temporal integration into memory as well as enhanced neural
              representational similarity. Although these data support the
              theory that the brain builds and maintains a mental model of the
              current event that represents recently encountered stimulus
              information, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We
              used fMRI in humans (N = 21, 13 female) to test whether
              within-event neural similarity indicates the persistence of
              stimulus representations in a mental model. Participants viewed
              trial-unique visual images that were grouped into events. We
              calculated neural pattern similarity across time in the
              category-selective visual cortex to measure stimulus persistence.
              Pattern similarity was enhanced within, compared with between,
              events in the object-sensitive left lateral occipital (LO)
              cortex. This was specific to situations when objects could
              persist within a mental model, suggesting modulation of neural
              activity based on the features and structure of the event. Left
              LO object persistence was correlated with activity in a medial
              prefrontal cortex (mPFC) region linked to representing mental
              models within events. mFPC activity also correlated with pattern
              similarity in the hippocampus but more generally across stimulus

              estimates of temporal proximity in memory. The data suggest that
              temporal neural stability reflects stimulus persistence in mental

              continuous experiences so they can be remembered? One idea is
              that information persists in mental models during stable events,
              facilitating the organization of events in memory. Using fMRI
              pattern similarity analysis, we found enhanced similarity within,
              compared with between, events in the object-sensitive LO but only
              when objects could persist within a mental model. mPFC activity
              correlated with left LO similarity when objects persisted within
              an event; in contrast, mPFC activity correlated with hippocampal
              similarity across stimulus categories. Left LO persistence was
              also related to the remembered temporal proximity of stimuli. The
              data suggest the brain dynamically maintains stimulus information

              findings have shown that activation in brain regions involved in
              the initial task performance reemerges during postlearning rest,
              suggesting that ``offline activity'' might be important for this
              transformation. It is unclear, however, whether such offline
              activity indeed reflects reactivation of individual learning
              experiences, whether the amount of event-specific reactivation is
              directly related to later memory performance, and what brain
              regions support such event-specific reactivation. Here, we used
              functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess whether
              event-specific reactivation occurs spontaneously during an
              active, postlearning delay period in the human brain. Applying
              representational similarity analysis, we found that successful
              recall of individual study events was predicted by the degree of
              their endogenous reactivation during the delay period. Within the
              medial temporal lobe, this reactivation was observed in the
              entorhinal cortex. Beyond the medial temporal lobe,
              event-specific reactivation was found in the retrosplenial

              due to a latent third variable, motivation. We quantified
              information-seeking, learning, and COVID-19-related concern

              COVID-19-related content and better memory for such information.
              Interestingly, this specific motivational state was also

              commensurate changes to utility expectations and were dissociable
              from the influence of non-specific anxiety. Thus, motivation both

              it's unclear how memory and perceptual systems interact to
              support the prediction and reactivation of sensory details in

              participants of both sexes navigated between animals to reach a
              target, and in the process saw a predictable sequence of five
              animal images. Critically, to isolate activity patterns related
              to item predictions, rather than bottom-up inputs, one quarter of

              patterns in early visual cortex, posterior medial regions, and
              the posterior hippocampus showed greater similarity when seeing

              related to patterns in early visual cortex and posterior medial

              what happens when we expect to see specific visual items, and how
              such expectations relate to top-down memory signals. We find both
              visual and memory systems reflect item predictions, and moreover,
              we show that hippocampal activity supports predictions of future
              expected items. This demonstrates that the hippocampus acts to

              representation of contextual features in humans is an important
              yet unaddressed research goal. Prior studies suggest that, during
              the acquisition of information from the environment, the dentate

              contextual representations, whereas CA1, situated downstream from

              constructs -- event components, event representations, lifetime
              periods, transitions -- and define them within the T2 framework.
              I conclude by arguing that: (a) the formation of lifetime period
              is driven by association and by repeated exposure to frequently
              encountered, co-occurring event components; (b) period boundaries

              characterize a prior experience. Successful memory recovery has
              been associated with the reinstatement of brain activity patterns
              in a number of sensory regions across the cortex. However, how
              the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortex
              contribute to this process is less clear. Models of episodic
              memory posit that hippocampal pattern reinstatement, also
              referred to as pattern completion, may mediate cortical
              reinstatement during retrieval. Empirical evidence of this
              process, however, remains elusive. Here, we use high-resolution
              fMRI and encoding-retrieval multi-voxel pattern similarity
              analyses to demonstrate for the first time that the hippocampus,
              particularly right hippocampal subfield CA1, shows evidence of
              reinstating individual episodic memories. Furthermore,
              reinstatement in perirhinal cortex (PrC) is also evident.
              Critically, we identify distinct factors that may mediate the
              cortical reinstatement in PrC. First, we find that encoding
              activation in PrC is related to later reinstatement in this

              regions that process the memoranda is important for later

  abstract = "In previous experiments we demonstrated that in rats there are
              two kinds of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity patterns (RSA
              or theta) as defined by the dominating EEG frequencies. RSA with
              a frequency of 6-8 Hz appeared during exploratory behavior
              (locomotion), whereas stimulation of the dorsomedial hypothalamus
              (DMH) elicited RSA with frequencies of 8-12 Hz. To determine the
              neural pathways involved in the mediation of these two types of
              RSA, local injections of tetracaine were made either in the
              medial septum or in the cingulate cortex in order to reversibly
              interrupt the functional activity of these loci. Blockade of the
              medial septum suppressed the 6-8 Hz 'walking-associated' RSA in
              the hippocampal EEG, but had no effect on the 8-12 Hz DMH-driven
              RSA. On the other hand, a tetracaine injection into the cingulate
              cortex selectively blocked the high-frequency RSA elicited by DMH
              stimulation, but had no effect on the 6-8 Hz 'walking-associated'
              RSA. Both effects disappeared between 30 and 90 min after
              tetracaine injection. We conclude that the DMH-driven RSA is
              mediated by the cingulum and/or fibers traveling through the

              Theories and empirical research suggest that shifts in
              perceptual, temporal, and semantic information lead to a chunking
              of our continuous experiences into segments, or ``events.''
              However, the consequences of these contextual shifts on memory
              formation and organization remains unclear. In a series of 3
              behavioral studies, we introduced context shifts (or ``event
              boundaries'') between trains of stimuli and then examined the
              influence of the boundaries on several measures of associative
              memory. In Experiment 1, we found that perceptual event
              boundaries strengthened associative binding of item-context
              pairings present at event boundaries. In Experiment 2, we
              observed reduced temporal order memory for items encoded in
              distinct events relative to items encoded within the same event,
              and a trade-off between the speed of processing at boundaries,
              and temporal order memory for items that flanked those
              boundaries. Finally, in Experiment 3 we found that event
              organization imprinted structure on the order in which items were
              freely recalled. These results provide insight into how boundary-
              and event-related organizational processes during encoding shape

               the same materials. In Experiment 1, performance of amnesic

              level using ultra-high resolution, ex vivo MRI. Fifteen autopsy
              samples were scanned at 0.13 mm isotropic resolution (on average)

              into 13 different hippocampal substructures using a protocol
              specifically designed for this study; precise delineations were
              made possible by the extraordinary resolution of the scans. In
              addition to the subregions, manual annotations for neighboring
              structures (e.g., amygdala, cortex) were obtained from a separate
              dataset of in vivo, T1-weighted MRI scans of the whole brain (1mm
              resolution). The manual labels from the in vivo and ex vivo data

              hippocampal formation with a novel atlas building algorithm based
              on Bayesian inference. The resulting atlas can be used to
              automatically segment the hippocampal subregions in structural

              changing occurrences that unfold within each event. A major
              challenge of our memory systems is how the brain integrates these
              occurrences within events while also maintaining their distinct
              details and avoiding over-integration across different contexts.
              Here we asked if and how distinct hippocampal subfields come to
              hierarchically represent both event context and subevents
              occurrences with learning. Participants learned repeating events,
              defined as sequences of objects superimposed on shared color
              frames, while undergoing high-resolution fMRI. Behavioral markers
              and consequences of event boundaries were evident across all
              repetitions. After learning, hippocampal CA3 multivoxel
              activation patterns reflected the event context and the strength
              of event representations in CA3 correlated with behavioral
              facilitation during event transitions. In contrast to CA3,
              dentate gyrus activation patterns became more differentiated
              through learning, specifically for objects that were close in
              time and belonged to the same event. This is a form temporal
              pattern separation that is sensitive to context, to facilitate
              distinct representations of subevent occurrences. A computational
              model explained these results by dynamic inhibition in dentate

              interplay between the representations of event context that
              shapes temporal pattern separation in dentate gyrus, and
              attractor dynamics in CA3. The results advance our knowledge of

  abstract  = "The function of the human hippocampus is normally investigated
               by experimental manipulation of discrete events. Less is known
               about what triggers hippocampal activity during more
               naturalistic, continuous experience. We hypothesized that the
               hippocampus would be sensitive to the occurrence of event
               boundaries, that is, moments in time identified by observers as
               a transition between events. To address this, we analyzed
               functional MRI data from two groups: one (n = 253, 131 female)
               who viewed an 8.5 min film and another (n = 15, 6 female) who
               viewed a 120 min film. We observed a strong hippocampal response
               at boundaries defined by independent observers, which was
               modulated by boundary salience (the number of observers that
               identified each boundary). In the longer film, there were
               sufficient boundaries to show that this modulation remained
               after covarying out a large number of perceptual factors. This
               hypothesis-driven approach was complemented by a data-driven
               approach, in which we identified hippocampal events as moments
               in time with the strongest hippocampal activity. The
               correspondence between these hippocampal events and event
               boundaries was highly significant, revealing that the
               hippocampal response is not only sensitive, but also specific to
               event boundaries. We conclude that event boundaries play a key

               seen the field of human neuroscience research transitioning from
               experiments with simple stimuli to the study of more complex and
               naturalistic experience. Nonetheless, our understanding of the
               function of many brain regions, such as the hippocampus, is
               based primarily on the study of brief, discrete events. As a
               result, we know little of what triggers hippocampal activity in
               real-life settings when we are exposed to a continuous stream of
               information. When does the hippocampus ``decide'' to respond
               during the encoding of naturalistic experience? We reveal here
               that hippocampal activity measured by fMRI during film watching
               is both sensitive and specific to event boundaries, identifying

              The first proposition was that brain networks support a set of
              reflex responses, with current sensory inputs producing immediate
              motor outputs. The behaviorist paradigm suggested that actions
              can always be explained as a response to immediate external cues.
              In response to these views, the cognitive paradigm argued that
              behavior cannot be understood simply as input-output functions
              because the hidden layers of brain generate unpredictability. The

              that cognition depends on internal models of the animal and its
              world, where internally generated sequences can serve to perform
              ``what if'' scenarios and anticipate the possible consequences of
              alternative actions without actually testing them, and aid in the
              decisions of overt actions. We support our hypotheses by several

              overlap of the representations assigned to different cortical
              patterns (pattern separation); and 2) modifying synaptic
              connections so that these representations can later be reinstated
              from partial or noisy versions of the cortical activity pattern
              that was present at the time of storage (pattern completion). We
              point out that there is a trade-off between pattern separation
              and completion and propose that the unique anatomical and
              physiological properties of the hippocampus might serve to
              minimize this trade-off. We use analytical methods to determine
              quantitative estimates of both separation and completion for
              specified parameterized models of the hippocampus. These
              estimates are then used to evaluate the role of various
              properties and of the hippocampus, such as the activity levels
              seen in different hippocampal regions, synaptic potentiation and
              depression, the multi-layer connectivity of the system, and the
              relatively focused and strong mossy fiber projections. This
              analysis is focused on the feedforward pathways from the
              entorhinal cortex (EC) to the dentate gyrus (DG) and region CA3.
              Among our results are the following: 1) Hebbian synaptic
              modification (LTP) facilitates completion but reduces separation,
              unless the strengths of synapses from inactive presynaptic units
              to active postsynaptic units are reduced (LTD). 2) Multiple
              layers, as in EC to DG to CA3, allow the compounding of pattern
              separation, but not pattern completion. 3) The variance of the
              input signal carried by the mossy fibers is important for
              separation, not the raw strength, which may explain why the mossy
              fiber inputs are few and relatively strong, rather than many and
              relatively weak like the other hippocampal pathways. 4) The EC
              projects to CA3 both directly and indirectly via the DG, which
              suggests that the two-stage pathway may dominate during pattern
              separation and the one-stage pathway may dominate during
              completion; methods the hippocampus may use to enhance this
              effect are discussed.",

              early to late visual areas during perception, this pattern is not
              observed during memory retrieval. This difference cannot be
              explained by reduced signal-to-noise or poor performance on
              memory trials. Instead, by simulating top-down activity in a
              network model of cortex, we demonstrate that this property is
              well explained by the hierarchical structure of the visual
              system. Together, modeling and empirical results suggest that
              computational constraints imposed by visual system architecture

  abstract = "In this programmatic paper we explain why a radical embodied
              cognitive neuroscience is needed. We argue for such a claim based
              on problems that have arisen in cognitive neuroscience for the
              project of localizing function to specific brain structures. The
              problems come from research concerned with functional and
              structural connectivity that strongly suggests that the function
              a brain region serves is dynamic, and changes over time. We argue
              that in order to determine the function of a specific brain area,
              neuroscientists need to zoom out and look at the larger
              organism-environment system. We therefore argue that instead of
              looking to cognitive psychology for an analysis of psychological
              functions, cognitive neuroscience should look to an ecological
              dynamical psychology. A second aim of our paper is to develop an
              account of embodied cognition based on the inseparability of
              cognitive and emotional processing in the brain. We argue that
              emotions are best understood in terms of action readiness
              (Frijda, 1986, 2007) in the context of the organism's ongoing
              skillful engagement with the environment (Rietveld, 2008;
              Bruineberg and Rietveld, 2014; Kiverstein and Rietveld, 2015,
              forthcoming). States of action readiness involve the whole living
              body of the organism, and are elicited by possibilities for
              action in the environment that matter to the organism. Since
              emotion and cognition are inseparable processes in the brain it
              follows that what is true of emotion is also true of cognition.
              Cognitive processes are likewise processes taking place in the
              whole living body of an organism as it engages with relevant
              possibilities for action.",

               equations) and a related qualitative part (plotting equations in
               a state space). Nonlinear dynamical systems theory applies the
               same tools in research involving phenomena such as chaos and

               investigating and understanding cognitive systems in cognitive

              the cortical reinstatement of these representations at retrieval.
              Here, we used multivoxel pattern analyses of functional magnetic

              activity at encoding and retrieval drive recollective memory

              Taken together, these results indicate that memory-guided

               the rules governing dynamical systems are well-specified and
               simple, the behavior of many dynamical systems is remarkably
               complex. Of particular note, simple deterministic dynamical
               systems produce output that appears random and for which
               long-term prediction is impossible. Using little math beyond
               basic algebra, David Feldman gives readers a grounded, concrete,
               and concise overview. In initial chapters, Feldman introduces
               iterated functions and differential equations. He then surveys
               the key concepts and results to emerge from dynamical systems:
               chaos and the butterfly effect, deterministic randomness,
               bifurcations, universality, phase space, and strange attractors.

              has been alternatively explained by mechanisms of decay,
              displacement, and retroactive interference. Another account of
              recency is based on the idea of variable context (Estes, 1955;
              Mensink \& Raaijmakers, 1989). Such notions are typically cast in
              terms of a randomly fluctuating population of elements reflective
              of subtle changes in the environment or in the subjects' mental
              state. This random context view has recently been incorporated
              into distributed and neural network memory models (Murdock, 1997;
              Murdock, Smith, \& Bai, 2001). Here we propose an alternative

              prior contextual states to drive contextual drift. In TCM,
              retrieved context is an inherently asymmetric retrieval cue. This

              around us, to predict what might happen next, and to comprehend
              language. What has not been so clear is the form and structure of
              this knowledge, how it is learned, and how it is deployed in real
              time. Despite many important theoretical proposals, often using
              different terminology such as schemas, scripts, frames, and event
              knowledge, developing a model that addresses these three
              questions (the form, learning, and use of such knowledge) has
              remained an elusive challenge for decades. In this article, we
              present a connectionist model of event knowledge that attempts to
              fill this gap. From sequences of activities, the model learns
              both the internal structure of activities as well as the temporal
              structure that organizes activity sequences. The model simulates
              a wide range of human behaviors that have been argued to involve
              the use of event knowledge and the temporal structure of events.
              Furthermore, it makes testable predictions about behaviors not
              yet observed. Most importantly, the model's ability to learn
              event structure from experience is a novel solution to the

              for brain science? In fact, many neuroscientists consider these

              organization that inform the question of the interactional
              complexity of the brain: (1) massive combinatorial anatomical
              connectivity; (2) highly distributed functional coordination; and
              (3) networks/circuits as functional units. To motivate the
              challenges of mapping structure and function, we discuss neural
              circuits illustrating the high anatomical and functional
              interactional complexity typical in the brain. We discuss
              potential avenues for testing for network-level properties,

  abstract = "Relational and conjunctive memory theory each postulate that the
              hippocampus participates in the formation of long-term memory
              representations comprised of associations between multiple
              elements. The goals of the current work were to clarify and
              contrast these theories by outlining the nature of the
              representations that are spared vs. impaired following
              hippocampal damage according to each theoretical perspective.
              Relational theory predicts that hippocampal lesions will impair
              performance on tasks that require the formation of new long-term
              representations in which distinct elements must be regarded in
              relation to all other elements. Representations that remain
              intact despite hippocampal damage include separate
              representations of distinct individual elements or multiple
              stimuli fused into a static ``blend'' such as several elements
              viewed from one vantage point. Additionally, the relational
              account predicts that rapid incidental online processing of the
              relations can be achieved through structures other than the
              hippocampus, but this information will not be stored. In
              contrast, conjunctive theory predicts that hippocampal damage
              will impair the rapid formation of unitary representations that
              contain features of elements and their relative relationships
              bound in an inflexible manner. Deficits in the rapid formation of
              these conjunctive representations result in impaired performance
              on tasks that require rapid incidental stimulus binding. However,
              intact formation of conjunctive representations can occur over
              multiple trials in the service of problem solving. Using these
              theoretical frameworks, recent findings from the human and
              nonhuman animal literature are reexamined in order to determine
              whether one theory better accounts for current findings. We
              discuss empirical studies that serve as ``critical experiments''
              in addressing the relational vs. conjunctive debate, and find
              that the predictions of relational theory are supported by
              existing findings over those from the conjunctive account.",

              missing. On the perceptual side, the dominant cognitive view
              largely underestimates, and thus fails to account for, the impact
              of action-related processes on both the processing of perceptual
              information and on perceptual learning. On the action side, most

              functional reach of the hippocampus extends far beyond explicit

              on a number of cognitive tasks including recognition memory after
              short and long delays and visual discrimination. Additionally,
              with the advent of neuroimaging techniques that have fine spatial
              and temporal resolution, findings have emerged that show the
              elicitation of hippocampal responses within the first few 100 ms
              of stimulus/task onset. These responses occur for novel and
              previously viewed information during a time when perceptual
